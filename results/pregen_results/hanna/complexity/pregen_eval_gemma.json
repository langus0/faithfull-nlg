      "Article": "Vitamin and mineral supplements are becoming more and more popular as health conscious shoppers focus on good nutrition, but do we really need pills to optimise our diet? Not according to nutritionist and author sarah flower, who says that cooking with the right ingredients should give you all the goodness you need. ` the cleaner your diet - using fresh ingredients and cooking at home - the less likely you are to need to rely on supplements to boost your health.' She told mailonline. Scroll down for video. It's time to ditch vitamin pills for a diet rich in clean, fresh and unprocessed foods, says sarah flower. ` the typical western diet is heavily processed and sugar ridden,' explains sarah, `this makes us more susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies.' And while it may seem like common sense to eat more unprocessed and raw foods, ms flower believes we are still not doing enough. ` we are living in a society where it is possible to be overweight and deficient in essential nutrients.' She continued.' A diet rich in oily fish, whole grains, lean protein, fruit and vegetables should provide enough nutrients,' she said. Other factors to consider include your ability to absorb the food - digestive complaints can often impede our ability to absorb nutrients. ` pregnancy, ill health and the elderly may need more support,' she said. And menstruating women may benefit from adding oils ( evening primrose oil ) and a multivitamin rich in magnesium to help alleviate pms symptoms ( ms flowers recommends magnesium citrate ). Always opt for steaming over boiling vegetables and eat as many raw pieces as you can every day. ` fruit and vegetables not only contain vitamins but also vital phytonutrients, which have an amazing ability to protect us against degenerative diseases such as cancer, alzheimer's and heart disease,'"

A medical practitioners tribunal service hearing in manchester was told a man referred to as patient a had suffered `extensive injuries' to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to ipswich hospital in february 2012 where professor peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo - facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher hamlet, representing the general medical council, told the hearing : `the case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.' He added that patient a had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told professor peckitt embarked on a `closed reduction' procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr peckitt was working as an honorary locum at ipswich hospital in suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in february 2012. A medical tribunal will decide whether he should be struck off the register.
