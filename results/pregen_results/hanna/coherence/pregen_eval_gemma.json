      "Story": "There was a small summerhouse my grandfather owned ... a farm that we called our \u201cdacha .\u201d Most officials had a dacha, usually a simple retreat or a cottage at the outskirts of the major cities, deep into their private hunting grounds. But my grandfather, in his Western cowboy hat and a torso so often exposed that it was burnt to a hide -- he was a man who felt it necessary to work on his time off. And with the collapse of the Union, he had a lot of time off while reformations were underway. We were n't usually around enough for us to keep any livestock, so instead we planted mostly vegetables. Beets and turnips, radishes and potatoes. We had an entire section just for poppies. Fresh poppy seeds were something you could n't find anywhere else -- though my brother often warned me that I should n't eat too many, or else I 'll fall asleep forever. There was a pond beside our home and a large river within a mile 's walk in either end of the surrounding forests, so we could just gather wild river berries and hunt for fish near their banks. My brother was the one who taught me how to fish. To cut the worms in half so we have twice as many, to poke them through deep enough on the hooks so they would n't wriggle off in the water. I watched as he took his small Swiss knife and pressed it through the worm, both ends dancing feverishly, absolutely silent, in the dirt. \u201cIt does n't hurt ?\u201d \u201cThey do n't feel anything ?\u201d \u201cBut he looks like he 's in pain .\u201d \u201cIt 's a worm. Do you hear him screaming? No. He does n't feel anything .\u201d Somehow, I could never do it myself without thinking about it. I 'd turn my eyes away and just press as hard as I could until I felt the texture change, the blade cut it 's way clean through the worm. I 've wondered if my brother ever had the same thoughts. The same aversions. But he did n't seem phased. Cut. Poke. Fish. It was just ritual to him. A process. He reminded much of our grandfather in that way. Quite. Meticulous. Somehow it seemed so natural, the way he could skin a rabbit or butcher a chicken. I always felt there was something broken in me, not being able to match their standard. I always had to suspend myself, to go blank in the head and close my eyes, just cutting up worms for bait. The two of them tended to the farm, mostly. I only watered and spread out the manure. When I was finally old enough, my grandfather gave me my own apple tree, which grew beautifully for about three months. Just when it was tall enough to warrant some supports, it just stopped growing. \u201cDid you water your tree ?\u201d My grandfather scolded me. \u201cOf course !\u201d I pleaded. \u201cI water it every day! I even gave it extra compost! I do n't know why it wo n't grow .\u201d He clicked his teeth and shook his head back and forth at my sad little tree. \u201cTrees do n't just stop growing, Yozhik .\u201d He smacked the back of my head, just enough for the crack of pain to connect through. \u201cI could have planted this in the woods and it would have grown on it 's own !\u201d \u201cI 'm sorry ,\u201d I said, but I was n't sure if he even heard my whimper. \u201cGo catch some fish, at least .\u201d His voice was dry, but the undertone of disappointment was obvious. \u201cHopefully you can handle holding a stick over water .\u201d I nodded and ran into the house. \u201cLyosha\u201d I called. \u201cWe need to go fishing !\u201d The farm was strangely positioned against the sun, so the only time it was properly lit up was when the sun was setting. There were no windows on the front end of the house, only the back, where my brother was sitting now. His hands buried, busily working, inside a burlap potato sack. The pain hit me again, but this time his smack was more sincere. \u201cI said *you* !\u201d Do not bother your brother with this. Lyosha looked up at me, his face serious. His eyes shone like a cat in the dark, just the light of the doorway behind me lighting up his corner. \u201cBut ... that 's the woods .\u201d I said. \u201cWhat if there 's a wolf ?\u201d \u201cYou have a knife .\u201d He put his hand on my back and ushered me back out the door. \u201cMy little knife ca n't kill a wolf!

It was a perfectly natural response when faced with your own mortality to rethink your life, and the choices you\u2019ve made, right? I hated to hurt her like that, we\u2019d been perfectly happy for god knows how long. I *loved* her, but after the transplant\u2026 Explaining this to the empty bottle in my hand was a little easier than explaining to Dani, it didn\u2019t look back at me with big brown tear-filled eyes. Still, they both reminded me that I was totally alone. *Fuck. * Why did I do this to myself? I should have waited a few more months, I should have tried harder! Why did I suddenly change? It wasn\u2019t Dani, that was for sure, she was such a constant person. I was *positive* the change happened after the surgery. It was like a light switch turning off, the moment I woke up after the transplant, I had fallen out of love. That was that. I should get outta here. Garret was letting me sleep at his place and I didn\u2019t want to piss him off and show up drunk in the middle of the night. I probably shouldn\u2019t be drinking at all, but if I was gunna be voluntarily destroying my life I might as well be thorough. I turned right out of habit when I left the bar, but spun right back around at the end of the block. That way was Dani\u2019s place, not mine. Garret lived uptown so I\u2019d have to take the bus. Checking the time on my phone, I realized the next bus wouldn\u2019t be here for another 20 minutes, so I sat down on the bench to wait. I put my face in my hands so I could better stew in my own misery, but a soft voice startled me out of my moping, causing my heart to thump erratically. \u201cAre you alright? \u201d I hadn\u2019t even seen her there. Her dark coat blended into the night, but I realized now that she\u2019d been waiting here since before I\u2019d arrived. She was tiny, and obviously not a threat; I tried to calm down and slow my racing pulse. \u201cO-oh. Eh, not really.\u201d I answered her honestly. I just couldn\u2019t make myself respond with the customary \u201cfine.\u201d She surprised me again by giving me a look of understanding, rather than one of polite concern. It seemed like she really *was* interested in my problems. \u201cWould you like to talk about it? The bus won\u2019t be here for a while. It might help.\u201d She replied gently, scooting a bit closer to me on the bench. What a strangely compassionate person. I looked her in the eye for a moment, they were a bright blue, and nothing like Dani\u2019s. Ah, *Dani. * I signed and turned away. \u201cNo, no that\u2019s ok. I don\u2019t need to bother you with how I\u2019m ruining my life, \u201d I sighed, putting my face back in my hands. She gave a soft laugh, at that. \u201cTake this from an outside observer: It\u2019s tough now, but you\u2019ll be alright in the end. As long as you still have a life, there\u2019s hope for a future.\u201d I peaked between my fingers at her, she met my gaze with a serious expression on her face. \u201cHas anyone died? \u201d she scolded me. \u201c... no\u2026\u201d I answered slowly. \u201cThen there\u2019s still hope.\u201d she countered with real fierceness. I didn\u2019t know what to say to that, she was starting to take this personally. I just stared back blankly. She hesitated for a moment, clearly embarrassed by her outburst, and ducked her head to allow her soft brown hair to obscure her face. Now I felt like it was my turn to comfort her. \u201cA-are *you* alright? \u201d She looked up at me after a long moment, a small frown on her lips. Her eyes shone but she didn\u2019t let her tears fall. \u201cNo, \u201d she answered evenly. \u201cMy husband died a couple months ago. When I saw you here, you-you reminded me of him.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d \u201cNo-no-no, it\u2019s okay, \u201d I reassured her. \u201cUm, how did he die, if you don\u2019t mind telling me about it? \u201d I could feel my pulse quicken in anxiety. I wasn\u2019t great at talking about this kind of stuff, especially with a stranger, but I didn\u2019t have much of a choice. \u201cMotorcycle accident.\u201d She said simply. \u201cOne day he was perfectly fine"

      "Story": "My first assignment with The Company was almost thirty years ago, now; I was new to contractor work and I remember being excited just to be in the field with a rifle. Excited to be part of a team of mean-looking dudes in multicam load-bearing gear, body armor, face masks. I was freshly back from overseas -- I\u2019d been a REMF -- and wanted to feel like a badass. We were assigned to protect a mining claim in northern Wisconsin. This was of course well before the first Water War in the southwest, and the idea of heavily armed private security at a remote mineral extraction site shocked a lot of people. I remember being on the news. Between my tricked-out M4 and padded gloves and the skull facemask, I made newspapers nationwide. Above the fold. Even though the other guys teased me for letting one of the activists take my picture, I remember thinking at the time that the whole thing was fucking awesome. Who were these enviro-weenies who thought they had the right to interfere with a private mining interest on private property? In the end we\u2019d only faced off with a few local protesters. Mostly hippies and Indians as I recall. We didn\u2019t even carry any ammo in those days. But for a wannabe trigger-puller it was a fun summer. I did indeed feel like a badass all kitted up, walking the property perimeter with the team, some of whom were actual combat vets. Something else stuck with me from that summer. One evening I was off-duty and went for a hike along a stream near the mine site. I remember watching a particular stretch of water as the sun set, how the light seemed to climb up out of the trees and how the fish were rising, rhythmically, eating bugs that were on the water and flying around, blinking in and out of the sunbeams. It was silent, peaceful. Like they\u2019d been doing it for a million years. Probably had been. It didn\u2019t register then, but that stream was right downhill from the mine site. A mine site that would eventually be mothballed due to water usage restrictions, be sold off by The Company. Ten years later the neglected tailings dam would fail and dump a million tons of acidic mine waste sludge into the stream, and into Lake Superior. I did see some action with the crew during the first Water War, the southwestern one, but it was mostly defending tanker trucks heading to the frack sites from ambush -- pretty easy stuff, really. Those yahoos had no training and no arms to speak of and we just wiped them out. Didn\u2019t even slow the trucks down, usually. Left them lying in the dust. They were slow, unorganized, predictable. Easy to hit. Wrapped up in cloth from head to foot, just like the hadjis overseas had been. Of course by that time Oklahoma was in full dust-bowl mode, aquifers bone dry, so such dress was practical. But as a child of the War on Terror period I\u2019d be lying if I said it didn\u2019t make pulling the trigger easier. All they had was desperation and desperation is not enough to make a successful guerrilla movement. But they didn\u2019t have to be desperate. They could have moved to the cities or the camps with everyone else and had their water ration. Sure, the ration system was imperfect. If they hated it that much they could have just bought water from The Company. If they could afford it. Any of these would be better than bleeding out in the dust on the side of an empty highway. The Company owned the rights to that water, legal and fair. Who were they to try to take it, based on some romantic ideal of public property? But that was the first war. Not much of a war. Some minor civil unrest. The leeway that the Feds granted The Company as \u201cCritical Infrastructure\u201d meant that they could solve such problems as they saw fit. Fitness, to them, came from the muzzle of a mercenary\u2019s rifle. Like mine. It also meant that I had a full hydration bladder at all times and a hot shower waiting for me in the barracks. I wasn\u2019t complaining. Things settled down for a while. But when the second crisis developed, the fouling of the Lakes due to widespread catastrophic mine failures, we were back at work overnight. The Company had wells up in the Great Lakes sand country and, being the last sources of clean water, they were prime targets for thirsty locals. A couple had already been hit by local guerillas, the crews wiped out, thousands of gallons stolen or spilled. It had been costly to retake them, so the Company sent us up to Michigan to guard this big one until they could bring equipment in to harden it. They told us this well had at one time filled tens of millions of 16-ounce bottles of drinking water, shipped around the country to be sold for a buck a pop. The young guys thought they were joking. But I remember it. I drank those"

That was the happiest birthday she ever had, so I would be twelve every year. She had a smile and a lot of perfume, but I would be so lost in my own bliss and wonder, that she would never ask me, \u201cWhere was my mother?\u201d \u201cAll the way up to my birthday. She was in my room, sitting on the bed, gazing up at the stars. One night, my mom, who was lying on my mother's lap, laughed at me and said,\u201d It's beautiful to see someone go out like that. You 'd be surprised how much she likes them, I remember, seeing them as old friends, and even visiting them. I miss them all. I don't really remember, but I can't help it.

The number of students who had spent their free time preparing for the coming war on Earth were still unaltered from the last two years but there were still a growing cadre of dedicated professionals attempting to gauge if the survival chances were as large as expected. James looked at the number of students with a curious look. He knew this to be their last meeting with them and many wanted to tell him to try and protect the Earth, as he was always good at everything that matters. The door to the room opened and the next look he had received was of him as a young man, he was wearing some kind of hardhat and with all the stereotypical smugness James knew that these men would have to be armed. He approached the students one by one and pulled his bag over his shoulders. As he got to the door he pulled a small gun out of it and aimed it directly into James'head. He simply couldn't remember what went through his head, but he knew it was the right thing to do, this was the final test.

What makes you ask ?\u201d She says. Dieter shrugs gently, shifting in her arms. \u201cI was just thinking. It 's been nearly four years since I came here and still ... Malvina, what am I ?\u201d The queen tightens the embrace on her lover, tucking her chin on Dieter 's shoulder. A slight frown, one tinged with melancholy crosses her face. \u201cYou are a good man, and a loving one. One who I have never deserved. Your love is the greatest thing in my life. You are kind, selfless, honest and strong. That is what you are .\u201d Queen Malvina answers. A look of rueful sadness crosses his face as he speaks. \u201cWhat I mean ,\u201d he says softly as he kisses her fingertips, sending fluttering waves through her. \u201cis what am I here? Mordnacht says that I am a slave. Am I ?\u201d Queen Malvina 's stomach drops as he treads upon the exact question she feared. \u201cMordnacht says a great deal of things. I would n't worry about what she has to say. That creature 's mind is half addled by time and the other half is full of schemes and plans. She wraps truth in lies and lies in facts. Her promises are worth their weight in gold, that is to say, nothing. Whatever she says, you must take with a grain of salt. You understand, Dieter ?\u201d Dieter frowns at what his love says. Eyes hurt at her obvious dodging of his question. \u201cOf course, but that does n't change what she said and which you did n't answer. Malvina, am I your slave ?\u201d He presses. Queen Malvina 's embrace tightens slightly as pain crosses her face. \u201cYou are what you believe you are. If you choose to think of yourself in a particular way, there is nothing I can do to say otherwise. Just remember, you are what you choose to be .\u201d He laughs softly, running a callused thumb across the palm of Malvina 's hand. \u201cIt 's almost amusing, I am the youngest person on this island, younger than even the little girl who looks no more than five years old. She is at least eighty years older than me. I 'm a child compared to every one here, and they treat me like it. Mordnacht says I 'm a slave, Sir Lawrence says I am noble man. Your subjects say I am beacon of hope and you say I am your lover. I am the only one who does n't know what I am. Am I a free man ?\u201d Queen Malvina says nothing as the fireplace crackles, the sound of the spitting pinewood filling the empty quiet. Pain flashes across Dieter 's eyes, his gray pupils wetting with tears. \u201cThat 's what I thought .\u201d He manages to finally say. \u201cMalvina, all my life I have not been my own person. For years I did as my father ordered. I hid behind the notion that I was not a free man, that every death or act of violence inflicted by my hand was because I was just following orders. When I finally manage to break free of his influence, I was washed onto these shores. Even if you think you understand, I 'm not sure you can truly understand. Do you know how painful it is, loving the same person who holds you captive ?\u201d \u201cI 'm sorry, Dieter ...\u201d Malvina whispers. A gentle smiles crosses his lips, causing him to lean over to kiss her on the lips. \u201cWe 're broken birds, Malvina. We were both born into lives of pain; you with your powers and me with my father. And we are both enslaved. Me by you and you by your own self-blame and doubt. The only way for me to be free is for you to be as well. Malvina, I 'm not demanding it from you, and years ago I promised not to asked, but ... will I ever gain my freedom ?\u201d He ends his question in a whisper. Queen Malvina casts her eyes towards the fire, watching the flickering flames dance about the fireplace. \u201cI know you and Sir Lawrence think I can change, but I ca n't. I am only sorry you were caught up in all this. If you had never come here ... I could have spared you all this pain. You could have found some other woman, someone who would have treated you better than I have. maybe it would have been better that way. Before you came, ever day was like all the others. For decades each day was the same, the same dull pain aching inside of me. I was more dead inside than my subjects and that 's how it"

It was understandable, our brains had evolved to handle only 3 dimensions of space. Luckily when the star had collided and forced the Earth into the fourth dimension I had been only about eleven years old, still plenty young enough for the neuroplasticity of my brain to adapt me to the new conditions. Moving through the field I ignored the deluge of information around me, even as I moved through it. I had to, I could see every detail of something in three dimensions much like someone glancing at a piece of paper saw everything on it at once. Most people in this day and age lived within the pockets of 3 dimensional space that remained on Earth, only the wanderers like myself were willing to explore the fourth dimension. We did so at great cost, sanity was the first thing to go for most but past that it was personal attachment to anything. Time inside of the fourth dimension is strange, and although it still linear moves in leaps and bounds while sometimes even freezing in place. Step out of a 3 dimensional space for what felt like an instant and three years or perhaps a second takes place. Their is no way to predict it, but still we Wander. \u201cYou are rather introspective at the moment ,\u201d said the Land. The land is something of a collective conciseness, those who go mad in four dimensional space eventually find one another and able to see every nuance of each other eventually merge. The merge also spreads the physicality of the consciousness over all of fourth dimensional space, a false projection of three dimensional space on a 4 dimensional substrate like a projector for a movie. \u201cI 'm thinking that you would do to not look inside my brain .\u201d The Land chuckled, \u201cWhy? Most Wanderers welcome a voice to speak to .\u201d I stepped into the water of the lake and through it, the water molecules moved through me unimpeded by my form. \u201cBecause most are insane, the people in three dimensional space treat us almost as gods when we enter their realms .\u201d The Land was silent for a moment and a thousand years. \u201cAre you not ?\u201d I chuckled and stepped out of the lake at the edge of another substrate pass-through where fourth and three dimensional space interact. \u201cI am as much a god as you are benevolent .\u201d The Land seemed to consider me but I withstood it 's gaze, it peered into my very mind seeing every neuron connected to every other, observing everything that composed the three dimensional brain operating in four dimensions. \u201cSmart boy .\u201d"

      "Story": "When Tyler entered the ward, his daughter Valerie was already fast asleep, her frail body no match for the potent cocktail of drugs coursing through her veins. \u201cShe\u2019s been drifting all day, so you didn\u2019t miss much, \u201d said Roni as she got up to embrace her husband. \u201cHow did the appeal go? \u201d Tyler smiled mournfully. \u201cNo luck there. They acknowledged my potential as a Donner, but I failed the psych evaluation again. \u2018 Likely to succumb to pressures from family situation\u2019, they said. No matter, we\u2019ll find another way to get the money we need for Valerie\u2019s treatments.\u201d Tyler and Roni sat quietly as they cast furtive glances at Valerie, each lost in their own thoughts. Roni was the first to break the silence. \u201cDid they say which project you would have been assigned to if you became a Donner? \u201d \u201cThey did, in fact. There\u2019s an opening on the Renewable Energies team. They think they\u2019re on the verge of a breakthrough, and one additional Donner is all they need to beat the Chinese competitors to the patenting deadline.\u201d Tyler sighed, then leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes before continuing, \u201cThe hazard pay was really good too. 5 years\u2019salary for just one month of being a Donner! And full psych after-care thrown in as well! \u201d Roni\u2019s grip on Tyler\u2019s hand tightened then. \u201cHave the suicide rates\u2026 decreased with the psych after-care? \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what they claim, at least. Some still believe that the utter desolation one experiences with the absence of Perogon-X2 is irreversible, but hey, if that\u2019s the price for increased mental faculties, up to a 100-point increase in IQ, there\u2019ll always be people willing to pay.\u201d Roni fished out a print-out from her handbag, and passed it over to Tyler. \u201cThis other group believes that Perogon-X2 is a good rather than bad thing. This \u2018 naturally-occurring high\u2019, as they call it, is the only thing keeping us from falling into a spiralling abyss of depression ... it\u2019s the proverbial wool over our eyes, but for our own good.\u201d \u201cYou and I are both scientists, \u201d laughed Tyler, \u201cbut you remember how we both thought that this surely was proof of some higher power too when the discovery was first publicised? Two birds with one stone! It keeps the majority of us merrily alive, while also ensuring that we would not run about unlocking the secrets of the universe until we were ready? \u201d There was no denying the contributions Donners had made to humankind. Tyler casually glanced around the room and out the window, and easily counted a dozen inventions which could not have been possible without the Donners. The hovercars, the bacterial foods with customizable tastes, implantable microchips for constant connection to the internet\u2026 even the drugs which commuted what would have been a death sentence for Valerie a decade ago to a mere ( if expensive ) annoyance. In a way, Tyler felt relief from having failed to qualify as a Donner. He had seen first-hand how some of the most emotionally-staunch people had been reduced to forlorn desolate souls once the Perogon-X2 was filtered out with the Masks. The degenerative process was universal \u2013 Donners would immediately benefit from heightened intelligence, but over time, they would latch onto and stubbornly nurse the perception that life was utterly\u2026 meaningless. Even if Donners were subsequently re-exposed to Perogon-X2, only 2 in 10 ever adapted back to normal life. The rest\u2026 preferred to simply put an end to it all. Roni\u2019s voice snapped Tyler out of his reverie. \u201cTyler, remember how I begged you not to apply to be a Donner? \u201d \u201cYes, I remember.\u201d \u201cAnd you told me that you had no choice, because Valerie meant the world to you, and this was the least you could do as a parent for her? \u201d \u201cWhy are you bringing that up now? \u201d said Tyler with a flash of irritation. \u201cI told you, I\u2019ve been rejected. I can\u2019t be a Donner anymore. We\u2019ll just have to find another way.\u201d Roni reached back into her handbag, and passed over a crisply-folded letter on embossed paper. Tyler began reading, and while he remained expressionless, Roni noted the bulging vein in the middle of his forehead, Tyler\u2019s tell-tale indication of agitation. Roni wondered how much resistance Tyler was going to muster, but in her heart, she knew what she had to do. \u201cI applied as well, Tyler, and they accepted me. They\u2019ve already fitted my Mask, and I\u2019ll be Donning it next Monday. We\u2019ll have enough for Valerie after all.\u201d -- - /r/rarelyfunny"

It introduces new information about the man's character without establishing a clear link to the story's premise. \nSeverity: 3\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"the reaper, filled with a great uncertainty, started to speak.\"\nExplanation: The reaper's sudden feeling of uncertainty is not logically explained. There's no context provided to understand why the reaper would feel uncertain in this situation.\nSeverity: 3\n\nError 3:\nLocation:  \"he knew it was hopeless, but he wanted to show his new friend something.\"\nExplanation: The concept of the reaper having a \"new friend\" contradicts the established premise that reapers are associated with death and individuals' lifespans. This sudden shift in the reaper's role is confusing and lacks coherence.\nSeverity: 4\n\nError 4:\nLocation: \"let\u2019s find a scythe!\"\nExplanation: The man's exclamation about finding a scythe feels random and disconnected from the previous dialogue. There's no logical reason for him to suggest this, especially considering the context of the reaper's presence.\nSeverity: 3\n\nError 5:\nLocation: \"he suddenly leaped out of his seat and quickly pulled the robe off his shoulders, exposing his new body.\"\nExplanation: This action is abrupt and lacks motivation. The story doesn't provide any reason for the man to suddenly reveal his body, making this scene feel disjointed and illogical.\nSeverity: 3\n\nOverall score: Poor\nExplanation of the score: While the story attempts to build upon the intriguing premise of a disappearing reaper, it suffers from significant coherence issues. The narrative jumps between disconnected ideas, introduces unexplained character motivations, and lacks logical flow. These inconsistencies make it difficult for the reader to follow the story's progression and understand the characters' actions. \n```"

I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a .357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I did n't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell."

He would always tell me stories about how her family had been raised to be your grandparents. Now my best friend, Niles, is going to be eight years old. His mother already thought of him with a smile when he was born, but she was a little concerned that he would have twins when they were grown up. My dad was always great with that. My mom and I adopted Maddie around Christmas, and when Maddie was fourteen she had our first baby girl, probably May. It was a girl named Rebecca. We would always say hi to each other, and we would always go out for drinks, go to some special places, enjoy ourselves, and feel like we were a family. But as the years went by, my best friend, Morgan had another son, Jerry. Jerry was nine when he was born. It was right before we got the divorce. So I was fifteen when Maddie decided she had twins and was supposed to go with them. At fifteen she chose to live with them. Maddie had a lot of responsibilities to worry about but she wanted to raise our child with as many people as she could. She even had a form for us at this point. Niles was eight and was a poor mom. She worked hard in school, she had a job, she got into university, she worked for her son while he was on his own. Maddie was fifteen and was a really good kid and her kid had lots of friends who were there for her at parties and soccer practice. She worked so hard to stay in school, but she was almost sixteen. I knew that Maddie's dad worked hard and she saw that as all good things. So I had to go to the doctor. Niles had something I hadn't thought of. She would give me pills when we came in the hospital. I would sometimes tell her the truth, but never believe it. The doctor told her that I needed to go in to a doctor's office"

The glowing green ones that I could read in the back of my memory? The new senses? Yes. They were all connected. I pulled the chair back, shaking, as if it were my fault. I couldn't see the back of my head and the green eyes, but I knew I had to make sure they weren't in my head. Something made me nod. I was shaking from the tingle of adrenaline. The first thing I saw was a woman in the kitchen. Her mind was racing, there was no other way to describe her. She was too big for a sitting position. Her body seemed to look like a stone faced statue, no matter how long she stood. \u201cHello, your Grace,\u201d I heard the voice say, my thoughts being immediately dashed from my brain. There had to be something wrong with her. I just sat there for a few moments, waiting, trying to make sense of what was going on. I saw her doorway, it was locked, I couldn't even hear the woman. I looked up at her slowly, my voice becoming lower as I listened. \u201cHello, my Grace. This is Lucy, your Grace. I presume you have the power to turn off one or more of your senses?\u201d Her voice dropped to a whisper. I ignored it. She took the pills and I was in. She didn't know that. She just saw me.

While not necessarily with his name, I know that he is doing it to take the life of his unborn child from me. I am a younger man, just recently, with a wife and two kids. My house is now in shambles, and my cat is away from me, dreaming of a brighter future. We live in a world where there are very few jobs, so I have no money to lose to pay for my life, I only live with my mother and her children. My wife and child are overjoyed at seeing their loved one finally get a normal life. I am not a man who lives in despair, I am a man who lives in hope, and I can not live in death without my children, my baby, and her. I never knew if I could survive with my life alone, or if it was simply a cruel joke. The things that I did and the things that I did not do gave me hope, and I became the symbol of hope for the world. Today is a very special day, the day when people begin to have my word. I don\u2019t know why, and I don\u2019t care about the future. I am here, and I can hear the sound of thunder, and my son's cries and my wife's heart thumping with anticipation. We are in a busy city, a lot of people, and we all can hear the thunder thump in the distance, the thunder thump of thunder that must have lasted the rest of the day. I am here to help, and I can hear the cheers as I am from the city. My wife and child are in the middle of a busy street, and the same thunder thumping that we hear has returned for my son. I am an orphan. I have never been a man, but now I am able to make an exception to this rule. My name is Peter, and I am seventy-two years old, and I am very"

Are they afraid of the unknown? They pray and stay silent, in their mundane lives. You call them crazy, until you start getting into the first stab of it, which kills you. No one does it to you. You, however, were now in heaven. Everyone else died, and you were the only living human alive. Now you wait a lot longer, since nobody really dies, just because you're making your own life for someone else. When people die, they get scared, and start thinking that they were shot by the Devil, but you know that it's nothing. They will not come for you. You don't think that. You just wait, and the fear gets to you, like you do every other day. Of course, you're afraid of what, you're angry, or afraid of anything, which is really the most terrifying thing that comes to your mind.

He might even have to go back to, *shudder*, patrolling the streets like a common policeman. \u201cWell do n't do that !\u201d He blurted.

Now The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived really was intrigued. He had always seen himself as the villain, it was all he had ever wanted to be but the last few weeks had shaken that view of himself. \u201cWhat do you mean ?\u201d he asked \u201cWhat if I was the villain?

You're all gon na die this morning. And the queen of a town in the work room, where nobody is gon na die, no room to talk to. Then you're going to die. It's going to happen to my next story. My greatest fear of death is that the true meaning isn't dying. That's pretty important to me because it's gon na die today, so that I'm gon na die today. I'm going to die today because I'm gon na die today. That's the worst. And he's gon na die today because he's gon na die today, that's why I'm gon na die today. That's all gon na die today."

Feelings of old people, sadness that 's creeped up in paint, veneer, wrinkled skin. Such stillness. Minds you just ca n't reach, that are always behind the horizon. I thought I would feel repulsed but I do n't, my beliefs in the world are only slightly hampered, and only temporarily. Somewhere on the edge of my mind is the tendency to blame it on capitalism. As if socialism were any better. It feels too easy. It feels like I 've been set up to make that connection. The endless documentaries and talking heads. Socialism is no better, and the truth of the matter is that we really do n't have an answer. I have this triggered sense of superiority which I loath. Mostly because it 's that: it 's triggered. I do n't have the answers, nobody does. Yet deep down I still feel I would never be so crazy as to take my own life. What were these people thinking when they did it? Did this forest somehow remind them of a museum? Did they want to make a statement? I was always thought committing suicide is an act of aggression. Did these people have a raging fire in their hearts, as they kneeled on the ground, quietly preparing their ropes, quietly setting up their tents? But the world played one last trick on them. It wiped out any sense of rage, of victory, even desperation. I only feel slightly less confident about the world I find myself in. A subtle sabotaging, an eerie, distant discomfort. My conscience is still telling me that I 'm above this, my personality is stronger, the culture I find myself in is more sane, I 'm more rational, my political beliefs are more ethical. As I keep pushing aside the involuntary thoughts I do not like, and do not perceive as truly my own, I feel I 'm getting closer to these men. I 'm starting to feel sad. My eyes are moist and sticky, I feel wet, as if I just got out of the rain. I have to let it go. Oddly there are no thoughts or ideas that get me any further, there are no lessons to be drawn. This is just what is. A forest with people hanging from trees. I 'm bordering on not judging, to be like the wind and the rain itself, and on forgiving: them, society, myself."

Still her wrath flared and she charged, trying to beat him down, but he held out the knife that found such good use in cutting the cobwebs'berries and remining the sick cat's wounds into silver buds."

They didn't have the man's face, or his \u201cface\u201d, or the mannerisms of the men around them, but it was what I had known all my life.

The warmth of a small candle in my hand brought me a good amount of comfort. I was able to stagger to a sitting position, resting on a round slab of metal to keep me warm. As I turned to look around the room, I noticed that everything looked familiar. No bedsheets, just a mattress with an IV line hooked to it. I picked it up and examined it. As I opened it up, I was suddenly left with a strangely clear view of the room. I looked around for some sort of weapon or a body, but I was unable to find anything. I remembered the man who had kicked me. I remembered the look of shock and disbelief on his face when I saw him. I remembered getting shrapnel in my shoulder, which wasn't part of his strategy, but being left with a sight I knew I would never have. I remember the look of shock as my body went cold and I realised what I was doing. My body was warm. The smell of freshly-mown grass and fresh clothes assaulted my nose, and I recognized the faces of all the people walking in. I was the last living member of a group of people that had gathered here.

Floating thousands of miles up, now he saw what was important as the earth below him, rotten and colorless, faded into a post apocalyptical nightmare. Red lights flashed behind him as he wondered how many people he 'd left behind. It was n't an easy decision, who to take; the ambassador of Iraq was one of the first caught in the cross fire of giants. And now? Just him. The President of the United States of America took his seat and watched what it seemed no one else would ever see. The end of the world. Red lights flashing, the air is running out. It was always meant to be a temporary measure, we all thought it would go away. They said they 'd protect us and now our oceans are their trenches, massive battle ships flying everywhere and survivors scurrying like rats, finding food where they can. The new rules went something like this; 1 year after your child is born, if it survives, it is taken to the training center. In return you get a choice of more ammunition, supplies or health care on the day. If something is stolen from you, steal it back, but most of all no one goes into a city. You keep to the wastelands as the cities of the world have turned into sewers, too rancid to even imagine. And so the people live along the muddy surface of the earth, sticking to forests when a new attack is launched. Grass does n't seem to grow anymore, nor bushes, or weeds and certainly not poppies. But people down below survived. The third generation of survivors was ready to take what ever life threw at them. Little did they know the secrets of their past. It was the second Cold War. During the Winter Olympics several Americans were arrested for suspect homosexual behavior, and many were unhappy. One thing lead to another, too many below the belt comments, one of the American athletes was publicly executed on live TV. War councils met the next day and strategy was discussed. For 16 years, silence. No bombs no communication until one day something landed in Russia. In sleek, black armor, tall and thin, like a jelly man that would wobble over at any point. They promised Russia that they were here to protect them, that they would fight under their banner. At a similar point in time, another craft landed. Full with an army in bright blue armor, muscular with huge weapons on their backs they pledged to fight. And so the war warmed up, and our new \u201csuper weapons\u201d turned against us in their onslaught to destroy the other Alien species. That 's where our story began."

If she was not happy enough, it was your fault, for I knew that neither sun nor moon stood still with her.\u201d I hardly know what to say.' ` And you?' cried the girl, throwing back her silken veil; ` had it not been for those roots that I was left hanging?' The younger dwarf did not answer, for he wished that nothing should be said about him. ` It must be true! But it is an idle story to talk of my life,'said he; and he picked up the sword again and made haste to reach the top of the tower. Before his feet touched it he did not wish to look back so soon -- he only wished that he might have only himself to begin with. Before long he found there a fountain watering the river, on which a thousand heads sang and no one lived. When the hero reached the place he looked through the shining window and saw two figures standing stark and firm in the water. The bronze head looked like a lake, and the silvery one was almost as big as a sun. If he had seen those two before he would never have thought that they were as beautiful as they seemed, for the other looked as if she felt at ease in the depths of the fountain. He clasped the water and ran quickly towards the fountain. His hand soon caught in the bronze one; suddenly he sank to the bottom. For two miles round and round he ran until he came up in the land of darkness where spiders and men thrashed about him, so that everyone he met wanted only to bite him. The creature became stiller when he got within sight of a vast river, each night glittering like a chasm; but always he saw the gold ornaments that dwelt among the rocks in their caves. ` Was that a boat?' asked he to himself with amazement. ` No,'said the girl again, ` the bed I strewed was a great deal bigger than this one.' And in spite of everything he heard the head peep out.' I know what you mean.' ` But, my dear,'replied the dwarf,'I have sworn I shall not marry anyone till I have saved you from drowning.\u201d I never heard so much of drowning'; but the princess loved him, not because she believed him, though she really was sure of that, but because she loved his kindness and his prudence, and because she loved him for his cleverness. ` Well,'said the head softly, stopping suddenly in front of the river and gazing at the young dwarf."

I can taste the salt of the ocean air, feel the soft sand beneath my feet and hear the roar of the waves. I am surrounded by golden sand and endless stretches of sea. I look down and see my shadow next to me. I look down to discern its shape, and then I wake up. The few seconds between dreaming and being awake are bliss. Then the hard reality comes crashing down on me. I look out the window. There\u2019s a moon tonight. The neighbourhood is lit up in a soft glow. It\u2019s risky, but I have to take what I\u2019ve got. Hurriedly, I pull on some jeans and a hoodie and venture out into the darkness. The cold chill of the air hits me and I begin to shiver. I walk briskly. At night, everything is silent. It\u2019s too late for anyone except for creeps like me to be awake. All the houses look large and imposing. The trees cast long shadows in the street and shake when the wind rushes through them. I start to jog to warm up, and soon I\u2019m sweating. I think back to my dream. Every time, I feel so close to finding out what my shadow is supposed to be. If only I could stay a few seconds longer, I would find out. And then\u2026 I\u2019m so immersed in my thoughts that I fail to notice someone on the other side of the road. We both see each other at the same time, and eye each other warily. Fortunately the moon has passed behind the clouds. He looks around my age; another bored teenager traversing the streets at night. Only he\u2019s not impaired like me. He looks up at the sky and slowly starts to walk towards a streetlight. The universal sign of peace. I see his shadow come into view. It\u2019s a dog. I\u2019m guessing a golden retriever. Under the lamplight, both the boy and the dog stare at me, alert. If I was a normal person, a \u2018 good guy\u2019, I\u2019d come under the lamplight and show him I have a normal shadow too. But I don\u2019t. I turn around and walk in the other direction, and hear him break into a run. He\u2019s afraid of me. The only reason anyone avoids the light is if they\u2019re \u2018 bad'. Their character is reflected in their shadows. An evil man creates a monster. I shiver again, but this time it\u2019s from loneliness. Why couldn\u2019t I be like everyone else? Why couldn\u2019t I have a shadow. The moon comes out from behind the clouds and the light hits me. I walk, but there is nothing beside me. Hopefully I won\u2019t meet anyone again tonight.

I was too young to have lived through the Teegardener War, but I 've seen old-style video clips in school. They were lightning fast, incredibly intelligent, and unmatched in their ability to improvise weaponry. They did n't come with fancy guns, bombs, swords, or powered armor. It was just them, naked as the day they were spawned, streaming out of their tripod wormholes. It was to their great fortune, and not ours, that their first wave randomly landed in southern Africa. It was pure dumb bad luck. If, say, they had started in the heart of the European Union, North America, or heck, even urban China, we might have stood a chance. But we lost too much ground, too fast. Before most of the planet was aware of the danger, they already had a sizable foothold, had consolidated and fortified their initial gains, and had already figured out how to fly our aircraft. All those unscheduled flights out of Johannesburg, Pretoria, and the Congo should have tipped off someone -- but those flights were \u201conly\u201d going to other places no-one cared about: Brazil, other towns in Africa, Yemen, India. As well, where the Teegardeners went, the grey goo weapons we first tried to deploy, but they co-opted from us were not far behind, finishing off the campaign of decimation their soldiers had begun. The news of invasion in the developed world began with talking about South Africa in the past tense, along with cities like Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Mogadishu. The Teegardeners marched up the Southern Hemisphere into the North, scouring the helpless Earth of its air-breathing masters, trampling every city and nation and grinding human civilization into the dust. Only the undersea nations and colonies of the world, the newest members of the United Nations, were left relatively unscathed. They had chosen us to be the messenger of doom to future generations of survivors. In one hundred of our years, they said, the second wave would arrive to finish off the race of men. After eleven tense days, they had evacuated their surviving forces back across their star bridges which deactivated and were left completely inert after them, perhaps to serve as monuments to their victory. And perhaps to serve as ever-present insults and taunts for the unborn generation they would someday come back to annihilate. They must have never thought we could figure out how their star bridges worked, but we did. In fact, we were always \u201cjust twenty years away\u201d from a lot of fantastic inventions that promised to save mankind from its own vices. But their portals provided the missing links that were needed in so many different fields. In my generation, we were supposed to fear and tremble at the hundred-year problem. But my generation solved it. When the Teegardeners come back, they will not just have to fight us. They will have to fight our friends: The Altairans, the Reticulans, the Kellerites, the Risatas, the Cuttlefins, and all the other alien species which the Teegardners have bullied and threatened and pillaged for millennia. They will have to fight all the allied races we made contact with using their own star bridges, once we understood how they worked. I ca n't sleep. I ca n't wait. I 'm looking forward to the end of the hundred-year problem. It 's not what the Teegardeners wanted, but it 's what they 're going to get. The Aries Terror ends here, on Earth, tomorrow. The Coalition will be waiting for them."

    "result": "```\nError 1:\nLocation: \"It was to their great fortune, and not ours, that their first wave randomly landed in southern Africa.\"\nExplanation: This statement contradicts the earlier claim that the Teegardeners were honorable and gave Earth a fighting chance. Landing in a less developed region seems like a strategic advantage, not an act of honor. \nSeverity: 3\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"They did n't come with fancy guns, bombs, swords, or powered armor. It was just them, naked as the day they were spawned, streaming out of their tripod wormholes.\"\nExplanation: This description clashes with the earlier statement that the Teegardeners were incredibly intelligent and unmatched in their ability to improvise weaponry.  \"Naked\" implies a lack of preparation, contradicting their intelligence.\nSeverity: 3\n\nError 3:\nLocation: \"The news of invasion in the developed world began with talking about South Africa in the past tense, along with cities like Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Mogadishu.\"\nExplanation: This sentence suggests that these cities were already conquered before the news of the invasion reached the developed world. However, it was previously stated that the Teegardeners consolidated their gains and figured out how to fly aircraft *before* most of the planet was aware of the danger. \nSeverity: 2\n\nError 4:\nLocation: \"They must have never thought we could figure out how their star bridges worked, but we did.\"\nExplanation: This statement implies that humanity's understanding of the Teegardeners' technology was a surprise to the aliens. However, it was previously stated that the Teegardeners were incredibly intelligent and unmatched in their ability to improvise weaponry, suggesting they would have anticipated humans trying to understand their technology.\nSeverity: 2\n\nError 5:\nLocation: \"In my generation, we were supposed to fear and tremble at the hundred-year problem.\"\nExplanation: This statement implies that the \"hundred-year problem\" was a widely known and accepted threat. However, it was previously stated that the Teegardeners gave Earth a chance to prepare, suggesting that the threat wasn't necessarily imminent or universally acknowledged.\nSeverity: 2\n\nOverall score: Fair\nExplanation of the score: The story has some coherence issues, primarily due to inconsistencies in characterization and timeline.

He had all the time in the world, he knew that he could do good in these days. He looked at his watch. At this time, 9:30 am he heard the alarm bells. It would be his time to go out, his time to get out of the bunker, his time to get away from his family. At 9:37 am, he heard the shouting of the police. They would come and he would be escorted out to the base. At 9:40 he heard gunshots in the distance, and a man in a trench coat caught his ear. His expression had changed. He felt his pulse quicken. He knew he was going to get away before it really started. He knew what he had to do, but not too soon. He approached the two men at the door to the bunker with the gun pointed directly at his face. He held his hand to the side. \u201cLet\u2019s go home, motherfucker\u201d said the man in the trench coat. He closed his eyes and saw the hatchet in his hand and see that blood was flowing freely in his veins. It was going to be okay, Kat had told himself. His family was safe, he could live with it. He could do good in this new world. He knew it would never be over, he had no desire to go back. The last thing he wanted was to be alone.

The story doesn't establish any prior context for this imagery.\nSeverity: 3\n\nError 5:\nLocation: \"It was going to be okay, Kat had told himself.

      "Story": "Waking with a start, my blankets strewn wildly about my floor, thrown from my bed as I slept. It was just a dream ... It had to be; there 's no other explanation for it. But, I 've never had such a vivid dream before; not just seeing, but tasting the cold mustiness of the air, feeling the chill of the marble on the soles of my feet, hearing the quiet rustling of unseen trees, the muted clangor of steel on steel, battle cries and shouts in every language. Shaking my head and sitting up, my pillows twisted and disordered behind me, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I look over at the wall and gawp, looking for a long moment as my cheeks flush red with a riot of conflicting feelings. -- It 's cold; my first instinct is to cover myself. Wearing only my plaid flannel pants, my toes flex against the floor, its hard surface almost slick to the touch. The guttering candles cast flickering shadows across the blue and yellow stones of the floor, send shades flitting up the length of the fluted columns lining the hall, and cloak the sides of the hall in dancing shrouds. I can almost see into the closest niche, to my left, a branch ... no, it 's been carved, so perhaps a club. Feeling drawn forward, I shiver slightly and let my feet move me further into the hall; the marble frigid beneath my feet now, drawing the heat from me, the dull roar of far off combat fading as I tread deeper into the hall. To each side, there are weapons, that much is clear, though the shadows and my need to keep walking make it difficult to catch more than a passing glimpse. As I walk though, some look vaguely familiar, a bulky hammer encrusted in runes, a finely crafted and gilded sword, displayed alongside its sheath, a Hasta, the point seeming wet with blood, even a series of bronze rapiers, gleaming brightly in the flickering light, the boar tusk helms behind them catching my eye. Moving still deeper into the shadows of the hall, a new sound reaches my ears, that of chanting, melodic and slow, singing praises, seeking benedictions, and giving devotions to God. The ecclesiastical Latin seeming somehow familiar to my ears, an instinctive understanding welling up from the very depths of my soul. To my sides now are effigies on the walls, holding their swords gently by the top of the pommel, gazing down at the path upon which I walk, seeming to both judge and welcome at once. One in particular, seems to call me off the path, my feet moving of their own volition, leading me to a towering man, his face obscured by the weathering of ages, but still conveying fierce loyalty, his cloak drawn about him as if to ward off the mountain chill. In his grip, almost singing to me now, is a sword, not as ornate as some of the others, but with a hilt inlaid with gold, small plates set over hollows along its length. The edge, though dusty and in shadow, gleams slightly, its edge seeming as sharp as the day it was made. In my gut, something tells me to take the blade and its simple sheath; so I do. The world explodes into a brilliant shimmering cascade for what feels like eternity. -- Leaning against my bedroom wall, supported by a simple, rustic kite shield, is the sword; my sword; Durendal. I can feel, almost hear, conflicted whispering in the back of my mind; one voice, very distant and faint, calling for a wife, a son, a distant homeland. The other voice, much stronger, but still a whisper, repeats a mantra in a tongue I ca n't quite understand, somewhere between French, and Latin, the tone unmistakably martial, a call to battle, a call to righteous war, a call to fight for my people, to forge anew the strength and vigor of my kin. At last, I understand. The men of the West must rise from their slumber."

I clenched my fists and fell on my knees my yell reverberating through the dark alleyway i found myself in. The gravel barely stung. Tears started to fall and in the cold of the night, in the privacy of the darkness I succumbed to every emotion eroding their way through me. Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement. A blurry image, I blinked and I saw a shadow of a man hidden behind a large dumpster. He could have beaten me, could have mugged me, even killed me and I would have let it happen. Nothing mattered anymore. \u201cDude ...\u201d His raspy voice called to me \u201c..you okay ?\u201d I looked over to see him wrapped in dirty old blankets, his hair matted and greasy. He looked at me with cold sunken eyes his cheekbones protruding from his face. He stretched out a skinny bony hand to crouch next to me. He reeked. \u201cI had everything ...\u201d I whispered. I felt my lip tremble. I sobbed in front of this stranger. \u201cWot cha mean ?\u201d He asked leaning closer until I could count every strand of hair on his eyebrows, could smell the dirty crumbs of food leftover on his beard. I swallowed. \u201cI wished for wealth ... I wished for love ... I wished for health ...\u201d I rolled over onto the ground glancing at the sky above me, murky water splashing on my once pristine suit. \u201cI wish for an end ... .\u201d High above me, millions of miles away, a lone star shimmered down at me from a blanket of darkness daring to dazzle the polluted atmosphere of the city. \u201cYo, man them sum good wishes! Do n't got ta wish for an end, do n't got ta think that way ...\u201d He plopped himself down cross-legged beside me his dirty bare feet wriggling as he spoke, \u201cHow 'd you wish for them wishes anyway? Dey come tru ?\u201d A cruel laugh escaped me. \u201cI 'm an idiot, I was happy I was doing well for myself but I had to ruin everything with those fucking wishes .\u201d The hobo tilted his head. \u201cWot happened ?\u201d \u201cI was rich beyond belief ... my ... my wife ...\u201d another sob at the memory of her. \u201c.. my wife and my children .\u201d We both turned as a police car drove by the alleyway, lights flashing, the shrill siren upsetting the night. \u201cEverything came at a price ... \u201cI continued. I sniffled wiping away snot. \u201cWait, here. Hav a drink\u201d the hobo pulled a large flask from under his blankets and shook it in front of my face. Without hesitation I grabbed it and took a large swig the alcohol burning slightly down my throat. I handed back the flask. \u201cMy son was killed in an accident. I-We were devistated ... at first. It was n't just him, his whole class died. It was horrible ... but then came money came. It was compensation. At first from the school, then from the district and it kept going until at the end we were receiving checks from the mayor himself. I knew it was because of my wish ... But all that money was tainted. He was only 6 years old, for God 's sake!

We tried to forget, we traveled and spent the money to try to buy our happiness but it was impossible. My wife and my beautiful 15-year-old daughter were depressed. Even I was depressed. My wife started drinking and my daughter started doing god know 's what at school. She started smoking meth. And we tried ... we really tried to save her until she died from overdose .\u201d I shed another tear for my lost daughter, so innocent so helpless. \u201cWe received more \u201ccompensation\u201d \u201cI spit out bitterly. \u201cFinally, I tried to end it. My wife was all I had, and I wanted nothing but to be with her forever. We mourned our children ... but then it was just me. She stopped shopping, stopped leaving the house. We had all the money in the world to do anything we wanted but all she did was ... .nothing. \u201cI covered by mouth as I shook. I steadied my breath. \u201cShe ... became catatonic and she was gone .\u201d \u201cBut wot cha mean gone ?\u201d the hobo exclaimed, elbows on his knees. \u201cWher 'd she go ?\u201d \u201cShe was still there, but her mind was n't.

This was the third body this week, hundred twenty-first this month ( something about vacations tended to up the number ), and an uncountable number each year. \u201cGlad we could haggle on this piece, let 's do it again some time ,\u201d the ruddy looking thief gloated as he ripped the gold chain off its stand and cheerily walked out of the shop. It used to be I would stare daggers at them after they did this. It also used to be that I mourned the loss of inventory, pride, and body parts. But now, now this was a perfect system. Adventurer comes in, if they 're assholes they kill me, steal things, then fence it for a tenth the price and it \u201cmiraculously\u201d shows back up in my storehouse for another greedy fool to try again the next day. The biggest problem, of course, was the back-alley magic fees to maintain the facade, but I could live with it so long as the process did n't have any hitches. Two hours later I 'd finally polished the blood off the back mantle when I heard the chime at the front. \u201cHello ?\u201d the soft spoken greeting was surprising for this side of town. More oddly, it accompanied a strange and sickening gurgling and scraping with each step across the floor, followed by the more usual clinking, squishing, and sloshing. Rounding the front shelves, a young, slight, almost pallid woman appeared in view. \u201cAre you the shopkeep ?\u201d \u201cWhy yes, Vlorium, just like the sign says. What can I do for you today ?\u201d As I introduced myself, I calmly tossed the bloody rag into a bucket underneath the display. Sometimes that impressed adventurers not to waste my time ... sometimes. \u201cWell ,\u201d she said dragging an absolutely massive bag into view, \u201cI think I might have some things to trade .\u201d The streak of blood and bile leaking from the bottom did n't phase me so much as its color. Jet black fluid with orange bubbles slowly rising and spotting its surface. I swallowed just a bit. \u201cMy brother was here a few weeks ago and said this was the best shop for an ID .\u201d She shifted the bag further into view and uncinched its tie, spilling out a half-hundred trinkets, weapons, and jarred organs. \u201cI just got my wizarding license last week and, my god, it 's amazing what you can find out in the world! I do n't have half a clue what all of this, would you mind helping me ?\u201d I still could n't see to the bottom of the bag, but despite my apprehension I forced a smile and pointed back at a list board, \u201cYes of course, happy to do that, standard fee of course .\u201d \u201cWhy yes! Here it is ,\u201d she pulled a small sack of coins from her waste and counted out the fee. Staring at the growing stack of cash on the counter, a small voice started up in my head. \u201cYou seem pretty sharp, most folks can barely recognize an granat, much less count the pennies to it .\u201d She smiled sheepishly, \u201cwell, I heard you did n't like to wait on such things, so I may have counted it out ahead of time .\u201d I arched an eyebrow, \u201cwho did you say your brother was again ?\u201d She waved it off, \u201cOh, he 's just simple rogue, no one of consequence. He just liked your efficiency, that 's all .\u201d The little voice grew louder, I could taste the slightest touch of bile, but I pushed it down. \u201cYour name then ?\u201d She looked up quickly, still measuring stacks of coin by touch, \u201cAnessa, lovely to meet you .\u201d With a curt nod she indicated she was finished. Quickly looking through the piles, it seemed like enough for whatever she may have brought, and I stepped from behind the counter, \u201cLet 's see what you have there. Well, right off the bat I can say that those daggers are n't half-bad, Xvisish if I know the make, and quality at that. Typical market value is at least 20 granats a piece, or for a matched pair a full 100. That bauble over there, that 's a Litrigan tusk ring ... a lower tusk ring. Hope you had gloves on when you picked that up .\u201d That received a shudder from her, and an unconscious hand wipe on her tunic, \u201cyes ... yes ... the smell alone ... I threw away the gloves afterwards .\u201d I chuckled, \u201cSadly that was actually a bad idea, that 's what makes the Litrigan valuable. God knows why, but some old wives tale has a tea of it. I feel more sorry for the alchemists guild, they have to brew the damn stuff .\u201d There was a slight gagging noise behind me, but I ignored it and kept sifting through the pile, pointing out valuables and items that"

It 's really the only thought I had time for. I opened the door. A trio of men were outside. One thrust a lamp towards me briefly, and with a nod, the men on either side of him stepped forwards and seized me. I was bound at the wrists, a sack put over my head, and thrown into a half-empty hay cart, where my legs were bound as well. I 'm not sure how long we traveled, it felt like an eternity; I could feel a breeze and the quiet hooting of an owl, a few pinpricks of light through the sack from the full moon. The cart stops; I am hauled out of the hay, my ankles unbound, and walked through a winding maze of corridors and passages. A door creaks, the sound of metal on metal, the hood removed, and I am shoved inside to land on my left shoulder with enough time to watch the door pulled shut and locked by a guard. Sleep is elusive. Instead, I watch the blue-blacks turn to purple, to red, then orange. Just as the blues creep into the barred window are there footsteps. Men with swords have come for me. I am allowed to see the corridors I am led through now, out to the rear of what I now know is a castle, to the fairgrounds. People are grouped in a half circle around a large pole jutting from the ground, around which furniture and wood has been piled. In the center of the half circle is a raised box dressed in purples and reds and yellows where a man and a woman sit in relative shade, as I am lead and tied to the pole. The rope binds uncomfortably against my breasts, tightly, as men with more wood come to place it around my feet. The man in the box nods. Two men with swords and torches set the wood alight. I remember looking up at a lone bird flying through the air as the wood catches and begins to smoke; oh, to be a bird, free from restraint and tyranny. As the heat of the flames draws closer to my ankles, a noise pierces the sky, and I wake to the sound of my alarm clock, soaked in sweat, and I and everything in my bed reeks of pine smoke. I did n't need the notebook."

Walk in peace back to your kingdom; that is wisely said,'and the shadow goes away. There is only his sword, though its blade is thicker than a earthen pot. As it cleaves this sword -- no one else will have it, except.' Before anyone answers he prepares some bread, and as he takes a deep draught from a honeycomb, he seizes up the last three drops. He holds out the drop for the man, who thrusts it into his mouth with a look of great astonishment. This indeed broke open quite suddenly, but, unhappily, the drop soon lost itself, owing to the thirst caused by the food it contained. ` Don't make this any worse than ever,'says the knight to him in that agony. And the other might well be urged into this kind of action, for then the Prince would naturally see that it was useless try so hard to be virtuous. By-and-by the creepers were loosened, and when it had been an instant the person handed the king his fair apple. And how glad he was to find it! When he found that he had got what he wanted he very calmly dropped the gold into the hut of the giant. Then, lowering down and taking out something more good than twice the amount, he laid it on the ground. For a few minutes he wondered where it all ended, but the moment he felt a steady beating on his heels he scrambled forward, snatched the apple from his hand, and carried it away as fast as he could. -LSB- Illustration: Page 17 -RSB- Farewell Madam The Elf and the Dwarf As soon as the little shopkeeper saw how foolish and indifferent she was, he threw herself at her feet in joy, and requested her forgiveness for all the bad things she had done. He thanked her, took off her hat which she wore as a woman, knelt beside her, and kissed her face. She gave him leave to kiss again; then they kissed each other every day, and the one who kissed most often became the fairy. They did not remain friends for long, and on their wedding night the elder grew old, and the girl wished she had lived ten years longer. Now the story concerns a young dwarf who was so foolish and inconsiderate that he thought he could steal golden apples from two giants who had fallen asleep, nor even approach the house. However, the wisest and gentlest boy happened to know that this was not so easy. He ordered them to be set upon the spot, and put a third of each apple inside the bodies of the men in white robes, with white bonnets round their necks, as if they had slept but yesterday. They must have stopped some time to drink, and surely the water should have chilled them to death, had not the youngest one of the men who was cooking the frogs made some noise, much louder than before, and spouted a faint rustling of bread, which covered the inn from the top. ` What nonsense you are speaking, poor boy?' asked the magician who had carried the apple from one giant to another. ` Well, you may have but one chance. You are to carry the half full apple in your left hand, while still holding the fingers out of the tip. But where is the fire going to? Just hold the tip out and let it burn out with the magic ball."

My life was a mess, I lost everything because of my addiction, my home, my friends, my dignity. The way people see me and talk to me is always a simple look, never looking me in the eyes. I smelled and look dirty with old sweaters and a unshaven beard. But everything changed when an old man in a suit, approached me with a kind hearten smile. He passed me a total of $ 1000. \u201cSir, this is far too much, I can not take this money .\u201d \u201cKeep it, you need this more then me, just promise me you do something with it, and make a difference .\u201d And with that he walked away. I did n't know who he was, much less know his name. But that was the moment in my life, where I cried for what felt like hours, that I needed to do something, I needed to change. So I used that money to get a suit, a shave, a hotel room ( with a shower ), and a used cellphone and laptop. And here I am today, as one of the top journalist in the city. But I always wanted to do something, like what that old man showed me, help someone that needed it, and help them get what they dreamed. So over the weekend I dressed up as a homeless man, and went prowling the streets. Almost nobody cared about me when I asked for change, some even scolded me that I should get a job. But then as I was walking across what seemed to be an old, abandoned shop, the door opened. A Young man, Probably only in his 20 's, came out and gave me the widest smile I had seen all day. He invited me in and served me up a bowl of soup, free of charge. From what I observed, the paint was peeling off the wall of the place, the place could barely feet 20 people, and nobody else was working there except for him. He talked to me and asked me how well I am holding up out there. I was amazed at his generosity, and that smile on his face never fazed. But when I asked him about his place, His face saddened a little. \u201cMy dream was always to start a restaurant, But both my parents disagreed. When I decided I was not going to go to college, and instead focus on my business, they kicked me out .\u201d he sadly said. He said he barely had enough to buy this place and rent a small one room flat. \u201cBut I had few to almost zero customers, I know I 'm no five star restaurant cook, but I know how to cook a mean grilled steak .\u201d he laughed silently at himself. But he said that was n't enough, he had nobody sending in work resumes, no customers, and his bills on everything was already in the red. \u201cOwning a restaurant is all I ever dream about, but the way things are now, I know I 'm going to fail, but I just want to be at least given a chance, you know? To show this world what I 'm made of, and make a difference .\u201d I thank him for the meal, and walked out of the place, before he could see any of the tears on my face. And so you have it people, an honest man just trying to keep his dream alive. And I 'm going to make that dream happen, I 'm going to be going to that restaurant for breakfast today as well as a signing event, I hope as many people can make it, cause I 'm not gon na lie, that soup was n't half bad. Article By Edward Pines ___________________________________________________________________________________________ The Newspaper was already starting to be stained with tears. My phone also started buzzing with what I assumed was people applying for jobs right now. But none of that matters right now, cause I needed to rush down to the restaurant and open the doors, cause someone in that crowd of people lining up there right now will probably be him, the man who made my dream come true. And he is going to want a bowl of soup."

It's not like I'm trying to give them the cause, just to force them to show up and claim my existence, but it's the only way to help them. The very act of granting someone's life is not a simple one. There are no stipulations of our punishments, there is no physical punishment. You're free to die your mortal life, regardless of whether your body produces the physical or physical penalty of eternal suffering. But what does that have to do with anything? As I am sure you can imagine, it's quite pleasant seeing my brethren. Though the life I've come to lead consists entirely of so much suffering, it's not that I think it's bad. It's just that it's been very hard to do so, if it were possible to do so in such a finite amount of time. I'm sure there is a certain part of you that we've found joy in and always wanted to help. The kind of happiness that is only found when the guilty have already shown themselves to be guilty. I've realized though, that even a punishment like this wouldn't be so hard if there were none. But alas, the punishment doesn't last very long. It just never does. I realize now that the part that I chose to grant is a human's life. One day, I 'll be ruling them over, or torment them, and bring them into my world. Those are the rules, and the executioners will have control of the morality of the decision. In my little cage, there is nothing to control except how they feel about me. I couldn't possibly lead them to choose whether or not to torture them. There's no way I could have brought them into this world, so how could I bring them to my lair, to all these nightmare horrors? Why couldn't I have, what could be worse? Why should it matter"

Growing up in a rich neighborhood, I never had what the other kids had; Ash got his first Pokemon when he was 5; Gary, when he was only 3. Because human-Pokemon interactions were highly encouraged, they would often bring their Pokemon to school and bully me with \u201cWater Gun\u201d and \u201cEmber\u201d. After one particularly bad day of bullying, I ran deep into the feared Turnback Cave and wept for hours. Why did they have to bully me? Just because my parents could n't afford the Pokeballs needed to catch Pokemon should n't mean that I could n't afford the barest respect from my peers. As my tears dried and the sobs turned to sniffles, I began to try to find my way out, only to discover that I was more lost than Diagla 's Adamant Orb. I heard crying and whimpers ahead, and, after approaching the sound, found several Geodudes and Onix intimidating a chubby and helpless Gible. Using my body, I protected Gible from the relentless punches and rocks thrown. It was the first time I was able to connect with another being. We both suffered at the hands of the many. As time went by, Gible and I became close friends. Though he maintained his stubby stature, his loyalty grew, and we gained each other 's respect. The first time I brought Gible to school was about a year after I met him. I could n't bear to leave him locked in my room alone for such long periods of time. The recess bell rang, and I headed out to almost certain harassment again. This time, though, I prepared myself for even greater harassment, as I would need to protect Gible at the same time. I could only strain my ears in hope that the bell would ring and call us back into the ( relative ) safety of the classroom. Rocks pelted my back, water stung my eyes, and fire charred my eyebrows. Suddenly, however, Gible began to glow, evolving into a powerful Gabite! No longer stubby and helpless, Gabite sported wicked sharp claws and a lean, muscular body covered in a hard shell. It seemed as though Gible had had enough of being a weakling and decided to fight back and to stand up. That day, my Pokemon and I grew closer together. It would not be the last time that Gible, now Gabite, would protect me from outside assault. As he grew rapidly in size and strength, the small bed I had formed for him was no longer able to house his powerful frame, and he soon moved under my bed. Though Pokemon to others may seems like monsters, my Gible was never monstrous. He was and still is the loyal and friendly Pokemon that I met so many years ago.

In one bound the air sprung up from under my feet, so I tried to draw the sword away from my face to make room for more space. Alas! I could neither draw nor strike my adversary; only struck him lightly on the shoulder. He yelled. Just like so many others who have done so, I have met with some success in Heaven.' After seeing the struggle between the man and myself from above there came on him such heavy weeping from the mountain of love to say: ` Your peace is mine, O good knight.' And my own departed brother knocked the point out of his head, saying: ` What are you weeping for? It is to our sweet sister. Aren't we unhappy enough in our position here as you see it?'' he cried to his wife. Yes, but God says that each person who doeth evil must come to a place of peace with himself.' And her husband looked sad and troubled. ` But the boy does as he sees fit,'he said suddenly. ` He will lie down as if to rest, and wait till the son wakes.' At these words the old woman saw what his heart wanted and ran back to her chamber. ` Why, where shall we go?' she said.' I have told you what I want.\u201d Well, have the seven demons come too?'' I don't know; why, you can kill them,''she replied. And the old woman went off to the opposite side of the house. But she was almost knocked down when her foot caught something hard on the kitchen floor. All the demons except two were flung down except the Man-lion and the Black Crow, who screamed ` Don't do it again! If you strike again we will eat you, and we won't hurt you anymore!' A frightful uproar arose, and the poor women ran into their rooms while the real four robbers threw themselves down under the cabbage bushes near by. They put a pistol inside their pockets, and made a fire for warmth. The angry warriors, thinking them their children, seized one of the brides-maids and thrust her up against the door. ` Aren't you coming, Jaqueline?'' I say, my dear sister.' I have promised this to your father,'she answered, and held the pistol to her own forehead. Then the robbers with the giant crow watched for the sound that might be made under the window."

After their surgery and his 45th Birthday, she was buried in the ditch, awaiting news of the Queen's death. The next day, he was found dead, his sword hung limply. His body had been sliced off and tossed into a river near Tipperary. The coroner\u2019s report stated there was some form of foul play in the burial, but no blood was found, nor any sign of foul play, at this point. The only reason the coroner had found evidence of foul play was because the Queen had been forced to die by herself. When she finally died, her body was found unceremoniously dumped in the river, with no trace of foul play on it. A plate of confetti was set to one side of the tomb, where it had been smashed. 3/3/2017 The British Government announced that it was their greatest hope to end the Queen\u2019s reign in this country, leaving millions of prisoners and almost every citizen living with social support to continue the Queen\u2019s reign. It seemed the Queen was against this action, so the government has removed the rights to her services. Many people have tried to join them, only to be met with the resistance of the Queen and her friends. They have, unfortunately, never been found. In the middle of it all, a group of soldiers stormed the building, they tore the doors to the room open, throwing the Commander and another person into the building with him, and killed all guards in the room. 5/6/2017 The Queen has fallen, and the state of the country has been terminated. It is now the War of Britain. The army has routed the military forces and are closing in on the area. After 40 years of fighting, the Queen has been put down, and the War is over. The fighting has claimed a thousand lives. Millions of people have been killed in the war, and the military has been cut off, leaving people without a place to go, with no government, with no government.

It was all in an old woman with the bus that was following me to the daisies. It's old enough to be so hard to be heard by her, but it's too loud to be heard in her family. She took the boy by the hand and called out the name of the Daddy's right. In it's my last kiss. I asked him if his date was up with her with her family who he was having that day. I smiled and answered. It was a little bit of a slurring kiss but I took him's voice. I was facing the part of the map and was shouting a wave of something under my breath and probably turned my back when I said it. I pulled my phone out. I was still on the map. I knew she was holding back tears and the new girl was gone. I was crying. I just wanted to know if my parents where there. My old sister was in the middle of the city or was dead. I was going to tell her if she was going to be dead the next day, but I was telling her"

Fire is a plague. **Lesson 2: Fire can be hurt** Fire is too simple to know it, but it can be hurt all the same. Kick at it 's heart, and snuff out it 's very essence. Use your boots, when you can, keep your face away from the flames. Use your hands, if you have to, it is better than letting fire spread wildly. Use your body, if you must. To protect those whom we are sworn to rescue. To protect our brothers in arms. **Lesson 3: Rely on your brothers. Rely on yourself** -- - Those were the only three lessons that were given to us, before we were sent into a conflagration. There was also a lot of physical training, certainly, to the point that I could accurately throw a flying kick to any surface from shoulder level down. I could even use my gloved hands with such speed and accuracy that the flames never seemed to touch them. Of course, the training grounds were nothing like the field. In the field ... strange things happened. In the field, Fire is more alive. It is not like the captive fire that we create and promptly snuff out in our barracks. It is not even like the careful, tentative fire that we fought on our graduation exam. In the field, Fire is more primal, more raw ... more violent. It pretends to be snuffed, only to bounce back a moment later. In training they told us never to turn our back to Fire. In the field, we learned just how hard it is to follow that maxim. But we fight on. We fight on because there is no hiding from Fire, not if we let it grow. We fight on because we are the only wall to protect our families from this inferno. We fight on, because there is no better choice. Once upon a time, I heard, they used water to douse the flames. Water, such a precious gift, wasted so recklessly. We fight on, with parched throats and dry eyes, because only after a successful day in the field will we be given our water rations to share with our loved ones. Meagre as they are, we fight on because to stop would be to die."

Yes, I don't mind if you gave me an order for ten pence to eat one of my young men -- but I will give you only one pence to sleep with me -- and that is enough. You must make up your minds so that I may be able to go back to the other side.' \u201cNonsense!\u201d answered Ricardo, who did not know what sort of woman he had been speaking against -- nor could she remember him being there at all, because she was so very tired. But as the girl explained it to him, he understood her too well to be outdone. ` Oh, you can have my child, yes, I mean -- she is the fairest baby, and that is all I care about at all -- but in the end she shall take the best place in the family. Now do as you see fit.' With these words she withdrew her handkerchief; the farmer rose early in the morning, and bound her upon his shoulder. With his father's permission, he told a few stories to the woman, as, in spite of all her wealth, she possessed nothing of use to anyone. How she has grown fond of him, how fond she has become of herself, and how she never knew a nice, patient woman not better than herself, is the story he said he would tell. She laid on her the richest jewels and jewelry-encrusted silks; every drop of goodness sold for ten per penny -- yet what the poor young man and younger son did was nothing in comparison with what she spent for this curiosity; for on the wane of ninety, she gathered so much treasure up in two bags for herself that her son also with the money could get just enough to carry home the rest, and thus finish his education and the business of toiling in cotton mills. To add to the horror of this scene -- which must not frighten them very much -- there struck the fellow by accident at the door not far from where he had strolled with his wife one fine day when she had got her first husband; and his heart sank and dropped out of his throat. ` Why isn't your sister here?' inquired she gravely as she lifted the curtain to show her as one of those beggars who lived in the streets. ` Surelyn't. And why are they standing up so soon?' ` I didn't think that I should be,'was the reply. ` Just wait awhile, and then I might get your help again. Here are three sacks of flour which you have brought from the mill, hold the little boy, and shut him up up in there!' So the time for supper drew near.' I saw that all was lost before I put out the fire and set it at our hearth,'said the girl as the noise died away, smiling faintly at the priest.' My brothers have been telling me,'she added, bending down to pick up the little bran-stone the poor man had thrown under the table.' It would not have burnt so bright if that he were not made of white sheep-fur; you need not worry about that.' So tying the goat on the same cords that hang above the fire made her appear for ever so modest. Then the old queen was taken in to sit beside her, and by turning the knob which opened that double door she locked up the priest so securely, that in six weeks she and the girl had their own way back to India. What she thought and what she did neither of theirs at this day is known to us. Even now, though many people live to old age without knowing it, this mystery is not altogether unknown to most of them. They think about whom they are dying for and how the first step toward death is to die by the sword."

There a red hair man was telling a joke and kids around him where clapping. \u201cThat 's George Weasley ,\u201d she said, \u201cI told you about him already .\u201d and she had, that secret war that run about 20 years ago, she was a little kid back then not even having received her acceptance letter. But now she was a witch, a proper witch, and I am her husband, which is nice, do n't get me wrong, but its so weird. Specially at the store. I bought the store 3 years ago, as I 'm a veterinarian I though I could do it, I mean, I just have to sell kids pets, how complicated could that be? oh ... boy ... you have no idea. I do n't know why, but beast behave different around wizardry people, I employ a kid that just got out of \u201chag warts\u201d! he, if Amanda hears it she 'll kill me, anyway, this kid can talk to spiders and they do whatever he wants, I have to be wary of him asking them to build nets in the door frames and not eat them every time i go by, but I could not expect less of a Weasley I guess. And then the frogs, did you know you can buy a potion that will send frogs to sleep? and that you can buy them by barrel because they wont stop singing if you do n't? I did n't knew I have been working on fixing a dog 's bad teeth and then having a pixie wanting to steel it from me, that was fun. Or when the house elfs came by and ordered and cleaned the store, what 's with that, they didn\u2019t even asked for anything and where just happy and chapping all the time, I almost shat my pants the first time. Just the other day there was an old woman who wanted me to find her a vulture bird because she needed a hunting companion ... luckily my lovely wife told her that that was illegal both on the muggle and the wizardry worlds. But what weird me the most are all those cages my wife and our employee handle all day, those that seem to have nothing inside, they give me the chills. Luckily I\u2019ve made some friends with the locals, specially this incredible huge guy who hangs at the bar frequently, he is always interested on hearing me talk about normal everyday animals, and then he talks and talks about things i can hardly believe, dragons and mermaids, nargles and hypogriphs. I love my wife and the world she lives in, and i love that i can see at least part of it, but some nights i ca n't sleep thinking about those empty cages, and what if my wife and myself are not seeing even weirder things out there. =========== I 'm not good at English: ("

The teacher bowed politely to his student, and leaving them to themselves, they walked back down the stairs and to their rooms. After dinner they dined together with their friend, who was a great deal prettier than usual. As he sat there, he heard no one eat, and not a piece of meat to be had for dinner. All he wanted was a nice nice fresh steak cooked very slowly to taste. But when he touched it with his finger to see whether it was just right or not,, the poor steak grew stiff and cold at the touch of his finger. He took out the hair, put it in his mouth, and made a pretty big croquette from it. Well, of course a small piece would hardly make much of a croquette, so when the hair returned and touched his finger, it grew even smaller and weaker. ` Suppose it grew stiff again without my help?' asked he, ` on which condition shall I let it go?' And the hairs began still growing and shrank even more slowly till there was scarcely anything left of them at all. Then the teacher summoned a fine lad with several faces, black as night, with a long beard standing right before him, his head for an oyster oyster. And he planted a small pear about the body and brought it up to the school boy. \u201cYou shall not have it if you fail so far.\u201d cried the Oyster-Master; but the first with tears went still lower than the last. By the second try his crab ran on. By the third try his spark grew faint, and when he tried to reach the oyster his arm was twitching like thunder. Then he made a right pirouette from the shell, and got away at once. \u201cSee, my son!\u201d cried the Oy-Master. \u201cThat means your little crab will soon wither, as little crabs do in a twinkling. Now take this crab and give it up, and save up your treasure; if the crab dies, we shall get what we want first.\u201d With these words the oyster was prepared and laid it out, ready by the Oyster-Masters. This done, there appeared in front of the crab's shell its shell and intestine, and behold! on it was writ red a sort of mark as a wolf's fur, and that looked like blood: and the plate broke upon it and it fell down into the ocean where it could not recover itself. The crabs were gathered together together one after another and taken back to the school. They thought the signs were nothing and wondered still more than before, as how anyone could tell when a big white cloud of purple smoke will suddenly appear and be what you promised them. The next morning a brave man came to the school carrying a big salmon from a great lake that is sheltered by mountains on both sides and offers splendid fish for sale.

She was on one of the long walks up, relaxing on a small bench with a leaf hanging out of the canopy, enjoying the sunlight. When she looked at her daughter, she looked up at the trees. The grass had a soft feel of hazel, brown, and orange. She even put on a shade of blue when she saw the shape of an animal on the other side of the lake.

Birdsong wasn't the most romantic time of year, even if you could feel it and it reminded her of the times she had gone to the park all those years ago. She should really get going out there.

Jim-Jam stopped and took a seat next to the the Jar-Jam memorial statue which sits in the main square. \u201cOne goal, one gift, one future. - General Jar-Jam ( dragon defense division )\u201d The dedication plaque gleamed brightly in the midday sun. A reminder of the sacrifice made by the elders just 10 years ago. From his pocket satchel, Jim-Jam pulled out a dragon roast sandwich and took an ambitious bite. He chewed voraciously as he watched the lives of his bustling village play out. There was Jay-Jam, the village spiritual leader. Originally from a town about 10 days on foot, Jay-Jam fled with as many survivors as he could gather when the mountain clans forced their way through the uninhabitable zone and claimed his village for their own. Jay-Jam waved at passersby as his children, adoptive orphans of war, passed out leaflets announcing the upcoming worship festival. Having finished his sandwich, Jim-Jam took a sip of pumpkin ale. An orphan of war himself, Jim-Jam has taken to hanging around the blacksmith 's shook. Jak-Jam made the finest weapons and mining carts this side of the Tempo river and is expecting Jim-Jam to deliver a very important package, a very common job for orphans of war to take on. As he approached Jak-Jam shop a little boy, younger than Jim-Jam stopped him to say hello. It was Joi-Jam, a classmate of his who enjoys reading huge books and conducting science experiments for fun. With courteousness being a core value of Portempo, Jim-Jam patiently conversed as Joi-Jam rambled on about the progress Professor Jet-Jam was making with his attempt to create a cure for the Jug-Jam Virus, named after Doctor Jug-Jam who first discovered the potential lethality of the previously unknown pathogen which claimed hundreds of Miners'lives. Politely excusing himself, Jim-Jam eventually made his way into the blacksmith 's shop and greeted Jak-Jam as he handed the parcel over. Jak-Jam smiled and thanked the boy, handing him a small sack of coins for his efforts. Jim-Jam jingled as he made his way home. The setting sun cast a pink glow over the calming village while Jim-Jam stoked the fire keeping his mudhut warm as the chill of the night air crept into Portempo. As Jim-Jam laid his head to rest, his mind started wandering through the possibilities the future might hold. Thoughts of joining the Village Defense Militia for glory, or being a famous Jez-Jez player traveling around playing against the teams from each of the 10 Kingdoms, but these are just the dreams of war orphans. Soon, Jim-Jam will blink his eyes in the new morning sun, waking up to a new day in the village of Portempo, with deliveries to make and a future to create."

But she tapped her foot on the stones on which she was sitting and instantly he could not wake up, and there was light in his eyes. ` Oh, he is in a great danger.' said another girl, And now I must teach you that nobody can help you. I wish I was with you.\u201d Please,'he said, rushing to where she was sitting on the blue marble floor, I promise, I will pay your debt, and can assure your heart.' Now a minute later the door opened, and as soon as the shadow fell away, her unmoving feet started at him instantly like wild animals, but that did not prevent him from holding on till they reached the gate of the palace; then he made his peace with himself by saying: I am sorry, I have only sworn that I would not lose heart.' Then his glass flew back, and he ran away madly; and by-and-by the princess found herself lying before the king the same way the night before.' King Pacha will sell me the news if you obey my orders.\u201d I am obeyed,'replied she. But instead of offering to buy the kingdom, they agreed to take her in. But the moment that Pacha heard of this wonderful accident he sent messengers to all the towns on the borders of the kingdom seeking for the rich young lady to buy the crown she wanted for herself. He had ordered one furlong by Gisborne to bring some black velvet gloves, two buttons by Falkenstein, and nine gold rings to sell in Falkenstein's house, the said clothes to be red with diamonds and the silk of gold. He sent word that the rich youth must be brought up. At the time of their departure the boy was walking home from the market after dropping what happened with the bill-bills on the table. Suddenly he looked in his pocket as before and noticed several little boxes all gleaming with jewels encrusted with carnelian dust. Through his eyes a sharp fear sprang up, and he had more and more faith in fairy gifts than he could admit. Very early in the morning he wandered off to his shop till at last he could find no thread to sew over his back. Whereupon he stole about an acre and a half out of his master's castle into the jungle till he found a cow dressed in garlands of roses and sapphires ready to give him all kinds of furs."

Back when I went here, everyone believed there used to be a swimming pool up there, but after a younger student drowned they decided to close it, and now his ghost haunts the school. My older brother claimed that the teachers slept up there, in strange, coffin like beds. All I know is that there 's something there, something that needs to be kept hidden. Now, I would finally be able to solve the mystery for myself. I stood in front of the tall, ominous door that led to the 4th floor. It was a heavy steel door, something that belonged in a high security prison, not an elementary school. The door made a heavy thud as I unlocked it, and slowly, I pushed it open. A gust of cold, heavy air flowed out of the room, followed by the distinct smell of old books. I flicked on the light switch and the florescent lights lit up one by one. I could n't believe my own eyes, on the fourth floor there was n't a swimming pool or coffins, but rows upon rows of file cabinets stacked up to the ceiling. There was only one thing that this could be. On the fourth floor of my elementary school, permanent records were stored. At first I doubted it, there was no way such a place could exist. But after a little searching I had found my name. It had everything in it, there was a write up about the time I had shot chocolate milk out of my nose at my teacher, it had all of my old tests, all of my projects, everything.

Fortunately, a lanceer didn't notice this, in fact, the latter was right. Mortadelia fled. But like the many other inhabitants, hundreds of survivors were those killed. One came from the front line, as a decapitated half of her society, two lanceers's lanceers fell on the latter.

Anyways ... *** I sat in the chair, tied down. I wondered where I would be sent. Previous offenders were sent to different places based on severity of crime. Serial killers or rapists might have been dropped in a North Korean concentration camp to be tortured and eventually die. Cases of severe fraud might have been sent to the Canadian wilderness before it was colonized to freeze or starve. The executioners though usually got a list of possible places to send the criminal based on their crime. They could pick whichever one they wanted. I know because I was one. I was booked for accepting bribes from mob to send their people to a place they could survive in. It was n't too hard because the machine did n't really keep records, and nobody really checked them since nobody cared. People could only get a general idea, within a few months if they wanted to by paying attention to the energy coming off the machine. If a location on the list was Hiroshima, I might have sent the mob boss to a few weeks after the bomb feel instead of right before as was intended. Regardless, that does n't matter. I 'm going somewhere where nobody will know me. Well, actually sometime when people wo n't know me. The new executioner was a rookie. I could tell. I mean, I could see the manual for the time machine from where I sat. He was taking a long time setting it up. Maybe he was deciding where to send me. The list he got was a few pages long. Would an executioner accepting bribes get sent to a horrid place like Russia under Stalin? Or maybe a less harsh place like an uninhabited island? I was curious. Personally I never dealt with people accepting bribes when I worked. The rookie looked up. I guess he finished with the machine 's console. Took him long enough. Damn amateurs. Wait a second ... Something was odd. I could see the status light from here. He was sending me to the future? I only did that once, by sending a mob boss a few centuries into the future. People would n't do that, too risky. The person might end up in a relatively safe place, or a really inhospitable one. No way to tell. Nobody could predict the future. I hoped for the former. Rookie mistakes, eh? The energy crackled. I was blinded. I opened my eyes. I saw ruins. They had a light dusting of snow. It was noon. The sun was low. Seasonal winter. Not nuclear winter. I looked at my watch. It had a Geiger counter. People wanted to cram everything into one device. I read in history how it started with cramming a camera, mini-computer, and a phone all in one. I do n't know when a normal person would use a Geiger counter though. Radiation was only a little above normal. Nuke Facts said that the level was like if I ate a few bunches of bananas every day. Kinda random, but it 's still better and more interesting than Cat Facts. That shit took forever to get rid of ... So I guess I was in the aftermath of a nuclear war with the clothes on my back and a fancy watch. It was safe to stand around. But I suppose I needed more than a lack of radiation to survive. I decided to head south, possibly to less snowy places. Good thing this watch had a compass. Something actually reasonable. Let 's hope that it also has a cookbook too, I 'm getting hungry."

Me, some friends, solving problems and slaying monsters. It was pretty fun, not extremely rewarding but job prospects are n't exactly great in my village. Just various shades of merchant - Oh, and one bartender. Anyway, I went on a particular adventure not long ago and things got pretty hectic. Our group was pretty tight though, we handled things well given the circumstances. We had Tess, my childhood friend and our white magic user; Edwin, this total dick from the village who just happens to be amazing with a spear; Slops, a wise, respected old knight who for some reason stuck with the nickname \u201cSlops\u201d; and Ren, a mysterious, extremely powerful Elf mage, reformed villain and all-round great guy. We also had this Lycan with us, Rex. He was cool but at some point he got turned into an *actual* wolf and sort of wandered off in the woods. To cut a long story short: We were tracking a big bad guy hellbent on world annihilation, and for some reason we were the only people trying to stop that from happening. Not sure why. Along the way, we burned down an evil, living castle; hung out with some ghosts; discovered an underwater cult which we also, somehow, burned down; and a bunch of other stuff. Ren actually revealed he was working for the big bad at one point and he killed Slops. Well, the heart attack killed Slops. We were all pretty shocked because Ren is just an awesome guy. He totally came back and saved us near the end though, which was great. Shame about Slops. The world actually got destroyed in some way, like three times. But we fixed it, somehow - I do n't know the specifics. Magic stuff. Ren 's the guy to ask if you want the know-how. At some point during the final, world-saving battle I was legally dead for about 12 minutes. I had a run in with some entity that rules the cosmos, and he declared me a god. I think that sort of spurred me on to kill the evil villain in the end, to be fair. Anyway, that was yesterday. I just sort of slept on it. It does n't feel much different being a god, to be honest with you. Not sure what I 'm supposed to be doing. I 've tried answering prayers, but I was n't hearing any of them. I also ca n't shoot fireballs - I think. I tried smiting the shit out of Edwin, but I 'm not sure if it worked. He 's such a dick. I 'm gon na meet Ren in a bit ... Just to, y'know, hang out. Maybe he knows a bit about this god stuff because he knows a lot of things. Such a cool guy. I might see what Tess is up to, but she 's probably with Edwin and he 'll cramp mine and Ren 's style. What a dick. So, Diary, that was my week. Sorry I did n't write for a while - I was saving the world! Hehe. I 'll update when I 've figured out this godhood business.

It's unclear what it means for everyone to be \"except for him\" and how hearing of each other as a family relates to the estate being set up in London.\nSeverity: 4\n\nOverall score: Unacceptable\nExplanation of the score: The story suffers from severe coherence issues throughout. There are numerous illogical statements, confusing timelines, unexplained events, and grammatically incorrect sentences.

And he was proud to say, that as soon as he arrived in court, instead of seeing old prejudice and silly laws which he has often heard, the nation seemed to be at peace and ready to make war.' ` Old dog still,'the king cried to his magistrates, ` so do what you please, this peace and safety I bring you today I can never fear anything. But remember, I declared it, not to let your deaths follow a wind of doubt; much had happened since I took power, we did bring our daughter-in-law here so many years ago in her place. ` Very well,'replied his Majesty, ` let me tell you honestly. Each justice was a girl that bore him a son, except Grandmother who died seven months later, which in the last judgment only put my claim in. ` Then you should certainly declare your claim,'requested Lady Miranda.

It was a soup she 'd made before, dozens of times, from the sad carcass of the Saturday chicken after Sunday chicken curry and Monday chicken pasta. This was the first time it had exploded though. There was carpet of grey dust over the olive green tiles; it turned the pallid brown of unfinished tea into a sooty black. It gripped at her lungs as she coughed on the floor. The detonation of her dinner had smashed her against the wall, and now she rose to a crawl, blind and deaf, retching the fine grit out of her throat. Above her, October 's retriever puppy was grinning stupidly from the calendar through the smog. Where she had stood, some mighty hand had burst through the ground, gripped at her oven, clenched at and crushed it. It had broken metal and stone and ceramic and torn viciously back into the floor below, leaving a great dark fissure hanging in the air. Her head felt like an old tire, worn and over pressure, that had run across a nail in the road and burst open. But she wiped the dirt from her eyes onto the sleeve of her overalls and looked up. The laceration loomed above her. As she stared at it, she saw in the black shimmers of light she could not focus on, like a scene reflected in drops of falling mercury. Around the edges of the tatter, wisps of shadow were curling off and falling to the floor. They drifted towards her, sinister leaves on the wind in a still room. Though her thoughts buzzed with pain and confusion and her vision was blurred by the impact and debris still hanging in the air, she gazed at the fissure and her breathing slowed. The dust had settled before she moved again. One quivering arm was placed ahead, and she shifted her weight from tired hip to tired shoulder and pushed a knee forward. The fissure still hung, placid and expectant, so she decided to move closer again; another hand, another knee. And again. It was within reach now, and she lifted her arm tenderly. As her finger brushed against the black, ice rolled down her back, waves from the fissure raced down her torso, hands gripped all over her skin, nails dug in and yanked hard. She was thrown into the void. She was sick, there was acid in her mouth, she was blind again and spinning and burning. Her ears were ringing. Her body was crumpled against the wall again, in the same small kitchen, with the same dust and shattered oven. The same dark tatter hanging tranquil in the corner. September\u2019s poodle grinned stupidly from the calendar through the smog. -- - The last room she would ever see was as clean and bare as the last hall she would ever walk down, and the last room she would ever sleep in. She was strapped tight to the steel chair, gazing at the whitewashed concrete. Her last day was not much different to the days before it: a rush of strong men in black suits, cold men in white lab coats. They moved briskly but had the speed of a routine followed regularly, not the haste of a group thrown into chaos. Her last thoughts were not much different to those of the day before either. \u201chow did they find me? Isn\u2019t it strange how your luck can change so quickly ...\u201d"

I genuinely believed I was to become someone who could n't afford taste when it came to fashion, but I could not have been more wrong. I became Damien Black. Damien was a mid-thirties, ridiculously successful, masculine heart throb. Chiselled body, dashing good looks and the perfect man if ever I 'd seen one. I had more money than I could dream of and I was better looking. I swear to god my sense of humour improved too. Suddenly I was surrounded by a posse of women as my escort. Sure, the Hawaiian shirt was difficult to explain at times, but boy did I not care. I developed one hell of a Cocaine habit as Damien, it 's where most of the poor bastards money went. Before I knew it I, Damien, was broke. I could n't stop the high life though. I 'd tasted the 2 % of the world and I was not ready to give it up. As Damien I 'd had contact with some of the worlds richest men. I knew where they were and where they liked to go, I knew where they lived and their partners names. Before I knew it I was driving cross country to commandeer these peoples lives. I would try and get close to them, but as a nobody that 's pretty difficult. So I started breaking into their houses, stealing their lives. Money, power and the high-life was my heroin. When I was n't someone else I was nobody. I could n't even remember my name, my age or where I lived. Memories faded to black. Ray had always kept in regular contact in the seven years since he had came into my room and saved my life. Often he 'd talk to me about what I was doing, he 'd give me advice and I 'd generally brush it under the carpet. He was a Demon after all, he was sure to lead me down the wrong path eventually. But this time when Ray came to me things were different. \u201cLook, Kid, I 'm taking you ability away from you.\u201d \u201cWhat! You ca n't, Ray! Please! \u201d I shouted like a child who had been told their favourite toy was about to go in the bin. \u201cIt 's time Kid, you 're done.

I 'm an Angel. I came to you that day to save you. I gave you an ability so you could see the world and understand that your life compared to others is unique. You are yourself, you are one in however many billion. You took that for granted and were ready to throw that away.\u201d \u201cBut I 've missed so much of my life, Ray. I never completed college, I lost my friends, my family, everything\u201d . \u201cAnd I 'll give it all back to you. I just need you to understand that no matter what life gives you, no matter how low or insecure you feel, you are unique. There is no one else in the world like you. Everyone has their battles, but we find ways in life to overcome our struggles, Kid. We fight. We seek help to fight. We seek support. We support others. You have one life, make the most of it instead of trying to live your life being someone else. Be who you want to be.\u201d By this point I was an emotional wreck. Somehow, amidst all the tears and snot streaming down my face I managed to barely make a response. \u201cOK, Ray. I understand. So what now? \u201d. I closed my eyes for only a moment and I was back in my room. I was stood on the chair, noose around my neck, ready to end it all. Ray was n't there. I stepped off the chair, took down the rope and sat on my bed, where Ray had sat seven years ago. As I sat there I saw something out the corner of my eye. Atop my desk was a note, from Ray. \u201cBe yourself, Kid. \u2013 Ray\u201d . I 'd spent a long time being someone else, so much so that I had forgotten who I was and what made me unique. The adventures I had, the places I 've travelled and the world I had seen were enough to make any man jealous, but it was always as someone else. Now was the time to finally be myself, to accept the flaws, the imperfections and remember what makes me myself."

      "Story": "His body was failing. He had taken care of it very well, but 205 years were a long time. Not a drop of alcohol all those long and lonely tavern nights, not a crumb of tobacco for the old pipe. He never had indulged in gluttony and he had moved meticulously through his sword forms every morning. Yet there is only so much the human body can take. And even careful maintenance of the flesh will not keep it forever. Two centuries had extracted their toll on their way past him. As Mathemer de Troy stumbled up the stairs, unpleasantly lightheaded and painful jolts firing through his hip at every step, he looked up at her face. His vision was bleary and slowly losing focus, but he still could see the fear and concern distort her beautiful features. She had been with him so briefly. Little more than 22 years had he had to raise her, teach her, shape her. She had barely been able to read when he first had met her, and now she would pass her Master 's defense with flying colors, if any Master would stoop low enough to haze ... a woman. Mistress'defense, actually - not that one had happened for half the millennium he remembered. The tower fortress was shaken by a shock wave powerful enough to make his ears pop. \u201cSo much for the front gate, Master de Troy .\u201d She tried to sound nonchalant, but he still could sense the fear in her. He had only started teaching her to kill ... She had mastered the technicalities years ago, but the concept itself still robbed her sleep. Little innocent Lia Smith, eighth daughter of a small-town craftsman. \u201cNo matter. There is still time, and time is all we need .\u201d She nodded and took him by the hand, pulling him up the last few steps by the remaining three fingers the frostbite had left him with. It was time. The laboratory at the top of the tower fortress was in disarray. Half the roof was missing already, and most of his expensive apparatuses were destroyed. It was frightening how much damage only ten minutes of fire from the mercenary artillery mages could do to a building. Cursed bounty hunters ... the next volley would take the wall. With a flick from the wrists he raised new shields, and with pride he saw Lia doing the same. She had come so far ... He heard screaming from the fortress grounds far below. Helmsfire traps or Golem Guard, one of the two was raising the blood price for his head significantly. In the center of the room was a contraption of two large chairs, back to back, sharing a single high backrest with a hole in its center. He looked at Lia, smiling sadly. He would miss her company. \u201cYou stand by your decision ?\u201d She tossed her head, sending her long black hair flying. \u201cOf course. The deal is much to good. Have any of your old apprentices ever backed out ?\u201d \u201cI never asked for their consent, to be honest .\u201d She raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat made you change your mind this time ?\u201d He smiled again, the warmth of his smile ripped away by lips revealing his full adamantine dental plate. \u201cMaybe remorse. Maybe you are the first apprentice I actually like. Maybe you are to strong to be forced\u201d. She smiled as well, then looked away. \u201cPromise me that my mind will still exist .\u201d \u201cAll memories, skills and knowledge - untouched. All character traits, morals and values - merged with mine, dominance lies with the stronger emotion. Magical ability - accumulated. The same is true for everything I am. I will not steal your body, Lia .\u201d He gently took her face between both hands, between the three fingered one on the right and the spring steel driven contraption that replaced his left, and kissed her forehead. \u201cI would not consider sacrificing the closest thing I ever had to a daughter just for another century or two. It breaks my heart to change even the little things that I will influence. I promise .\u201d She nodded and wiped away a tear. She took her seat and watched her master use his spring-driven arm to lock her head into place against the hole in the headrest by tightly screwing down a crystal headdress. He touched her face in passing one last time. \u201cGood bye, Lia Smith .\u201d As he took his seat behind her, Master Mathemer de Troy regretted not finding another apprentice. Someone closer to his own character, but weaker. Someone he would miss less talking too. Preferably male, for the stronger sword arm, and the quick and painless ascend into the ranks of Masters. But he had never found another as talented and powerful as little Lia. And now the time was out. Life was not always quick an painless ... Mentally linking to the apparatus was easy. Linking to Lia proved a lot harder"

And perhaps I never should have tried .\u201d \u201c*Saved* ?\u201d The word was bitter and bile in Casper 's mouth. \u201cHave you any idea of the lives you 've taken? The blood you 've spilled ?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, of course .\u201d The Emperor swept a thin hand down across the dais. \u201cThere. Penbrook. My most honorable man-at-arms. He was a smithy when I met him, if you can believe that. A good one, as well. A good *man*. Four children. Beautiful, courageous Eileen back home. He loved darts. Had no taste for gambling. Painted. Worried about my health. Worried about this kingdom. A good man .\u201d The Emperor nodded. \u201cDead. All of them, dead. My men. *Your* men. Your horse - a beautiful horse, I should add. And brave. I saw the way it leapt across the fiery moat. No other horse would do such a thing .\u201d \u201cDead defending you ,\u201d said Casper, cold, barely above a whisper. \u201cDead trying to *kill* you. Dead because of you and the horrors you have unleashed upon this land .\u201d \u201cCertainly ,\u201d said the Emperor. \u201cAnd I do n't suppose you could be convinced to allow me to continue as I was, eh ?\u201d Casper laughed, nearly weeping with exhaustion and spoiled anxiety. \u201cI never would have guessed you 'd have a sense of humor .\u201d He drew a deep breath and leveled his sword. \u201cBut I guess I do n't have much room in my heart for laughter these days .\u201d The Emperor smiled, careful eyes never leaving Casper 's face. \u201cI would n't go so far as to say that the things I 've done have been justified, but it seems it would serve us both to understand what 's at stake .\u201d \u201cYour death ,\u201d said Casper mildly, advancing on the older man. \u201cThat is the only thing left on the table. Your reign of terror ends today .\u201d \u201cI 've seen the world - what it becomes ,\u201d said the Emperor hastily, drawing back in his chair. \u201cI 've seen the future. I see it every night when I close my eyes .\u201d \u201cI 'm not concerned with the future ,\u201d said Casper. \u201cEveryone I 've ever loved is dead. My home is half in ruin. What do your nightmares mean to me ?\u201d \u201cThe *world* ,\u201d said the Gray Emperor, clutching at the arms of his throne. \u201cYou have no idea what it wants to become. No matter what hell you think I 've made here on Earth, you must believe me when I tell how much *worse* it threatens to become .\u201d \u201cWorse than murder ?\u201d said Casper. \u201cVillages burned to the ground? Bloodlines *erased*? Worse than that ?\u201d The Emperor sighed. \u201cI do n't suppose I would ever be able to convince you, but the things I have seen ... they are haunting in ways you could not imagine. What human beings become ... what they do to one another ...\u201d \u201cI have seen the worst of what a human may do .\u201d \u201cThen imagine *demons* !\u201d shouted the Emperor. \u201cImagine wraiths! Imagine soulless abominations. Feeling nothing. Being nothing. Simply consuming. Ravaging. Anything and everything. Until there is nothing. Because *that* is what I see. *That* is what man strives to make of himself. \u201cI am not a godly man and I do not consider my works holy in any way, but know that the evil I do, I do for the better sake of all mankind. It is a protection. A benediction. I am the evil of the world. I give men like you focus. Hunger. Ambition. I am the lone demon in the dark. And when I am gone, there will be no evil but the evil inside your hearts. The world will be overrun with apathy. No one will be spared .\u201d The Emperor took a slow, steadying breath. Casper watched the old man sweat and shake. \u201cWhat you describe sounds like freedom ,\u201d said Casper after some time. \u201cIt is Hell ,\u201d said the Emperor. \u201cAnd what if it was just a bad dream ?\u201d The Emperor considered this for some time. \u201cThen I suppose this must be part of the dream, because what torment could be worse than to have done what I 've done ... and been wrong ?\u201d Casper placed the tip of his sword under the Emperor 's neck. \u201cShould I wake you ?\u201d"

He was testing it out by attempting to disable the iPad. But when he realized how advanced the device was, he decided to stop all the reddit content from reaching everyone. He shut all the doors of this country down and replaced the digital forms with digital memories of you online. However, when the thousands of users he erased began to burn into the earth and die, Zuckerberg was devastated. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Zuckerberg asked himself. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d He put the iPad to his ear.

As soon as it did, the screams of thousands started in the background of the tablet. It was after about 15 minutes when Zuckerberg realized what was happening. He walked back to his house and moved his friends and family. He had not slept well last night. When he arrived, he was met by the table of his uncle. \u201cDo you mind if I bring you breakfast?\u201d He asked. \u201cI should go.\u201d \u201cAlright, we 'll get you that breakfast soon.\u201d Zuckerberg blinked at the smile on his uncle's face. He took the apple he was holding and he gave a small smile. He ate his breakfast, set his bag of chips and headed outside. As he walked down the street, he felt some sadness. He was never really a very good guy and he was quite a big fan of Richard Dawkins.

      "Story": "Ever since we were kids, me and the boys dreamed of our big break. We all played cops and robbers back in the day, right? Yeah, well, when we played it, we *really* played it. We drew straws to see who was cops and who was robbers. Short straws were cops. It was more fun to be the robbers, 'cause robbers are the ones who got a shot at making it big. At least they got a shot, you know? What do cops have? Nothing but problems. And every week we 'd pack into each other 's houses and listen to our programs on the radio set. When other kids were listening to Uncle Don, we tuned in to the Mystery House, and let me tell you, we did n't root for the good guys. Forget Charles Lindbergh, Torrio was the real hero on our block. This is some good bourbon, ai n't it? Got just the right kind of spice in it. Not too much, not too little; goes down just smooth enough. You ever try that shit back in the day? The bootleg stuff? Pops used to give me a sip every now and again before he got nabbed, God rest his soul. I do n't even know how we made it without him, you know? The early part of that decade was every bit as dirty as its name. Guess that 's what gave me my predilection for scheming. Well, we got a little older and a little smarter and we started to make plans. We were really going to do this! Like, really do it, and we were going to do it right. Getting in was the easy part, you know, but getting out was hard. We had to plan it from the inside out. But ... time goes by, things get put on hold, you get a real job ... \u201cReal .\u201d Like that word 's supposed to mean something when you grew up how we did? You ca n't just get a \u201creal\u201d job and get out of there. No, real only cuts it for so long. We 'd been talking for years before we finally sat down one day and said \u201cHey, if we 're gon na do this thing, we got ta do it now. We are n't getting any younger .\u201d So me and Joey and Felix - Ha ha! Felix! Like the cat! - we bought some tommies from one of my dad 's old connections, a number runner from the south part. So we tell our wives - we were all married at the time, see - that we 're heading to work like normal, but we meet up at the park. We get into my car and I drive us down to the Fullerton State Bank. The thing goes off without a hitch, just like the programs. We bust in, tell everyone to drop to the tiles, and they put the money in the bag. Two hundred grand. We had two hundred grand in our hands, and we never had to fire a shot! Sometimes things just go right, you know? The cops must have been in the area already, 'cause they showed up real quick, a lot quicker than we thought they would. And who was the first uniform through that door? Butch Carwell, the bastard. Yeah, we knew him, so did the whole city. He was a mean son of a bitch with a bad attitude, known to light up like a candle if you push too hard, just like his dad. Well, that was just our luck. There was a swarm of police following him. We just set our weapons down and gave ourselves up. So Carwell puts us in the back of his car, handcuffs and all, and starts driving. We still had our eyes on that bag, though. He had it in the front seat next to him to take as evidence, but we could n't reach it all tied up. He waits for the other cars to set out back to the station and then he follows 'em. \u201cWhat 's in the bag ?\u201d he says. Joey 's kind of a smartass and responds \u201cWhat 's in the bag? Money 's in the bag, you dolt! What do you think ?\u201d \u201cFunny, funny ,\u201d he says. He says \u201cHow much you got in there ?\u201d Felix says \u201cTwo hundred thousand ,\u201d and Butch does n't say a word. He 's a cop! He 's probably never seen that much money in his life. I think the nostalgia hit him right then, see. We always wanted to be the robbers, cause they were the ones who had a shot. We see the cruisers ahead drive straight and Butch takes a left. Two more blocks and he takes another. We drive for a few minutes and get to the empty lot out front of Merl 's Hardware - it 's closed on Mondays - where his street car is parked. He pulls up beside it, opens the back doors and lets us"

      "Story": "Two years, 142 days. That 's how long i 've lived without her. She was my life, my other half, and every other cliche in the book combined; I ca n't think of anything better to describe how much she meant to me. When I found out she was cheating on me with her boss, I ca n't articulate into words how much I was hurt. I guess it would have been better if she put up a fight for me - told me she cared about me and all of that shit - even if I knew it was all a lie. Because then I would have closure, been able to say \u201cwe left each-other for this reason\u201d. But I did n't get that. When I first found out, she grabbed her clothes and out daughter and left. No words. No goodbye. The other half - no - the entirety of my life suddenly and without warning left me. So for 2 1/2 years I have gotten through it. For 873 days, I have made myself trudge through the featureless, flat, futile experiment of life without her. Trudged is perhaps the wrong word. That implies the ability to walk, or even progress at all. Instead I fell flat on my face, barely keeping my head above the muck for long enough to take a gasp of air and refrain from asphyxiating myself in a mixture of alcohol and self-pity. There were days when I would wake up with no memory of what happened the night before; days when I would wake up 20 miles form my house and eve still days when I would wake up with a throng of people I had never met in my house. Whether it was my own version of postpartum depression or a product of excessive drinking I could never tell - it was most likely a mixture of both. Last night, however, changed al of this. I went through my daily routine, the one I had adapted to stop my already speedy descent into homelessness, and came home to finish out my day. I showered, ate, and got ready to go into the bed I used to share with the woman I loved. At some point during the night, after I had fallen asleep, I rolled over and felt something hard on the other side of the bed. A million different thoughts rushed through my head, foremost being that she had come back. Had she been too embarrassed to speak to me and instead climbed int my bed to continue things where they we so abruptly left? Had I drunkenly called her and asked her to come over and she obliged? As the millions of thoughts rushed through my head all in an instant, I began to caress her - something I so greatly missed. I still remembered every detail, every freckle and imperfection on her body. Her hair - she must have cut it short, this felt much different. It was much more course than I remember it being then too - maybe a product of the stress of her new life? But then my hands reached her body. Her skin, much rougher and less soft than I remembered. Her hips, much smaller? This made no sense. In my half-awake stupor, I turned don the light to investigate the changes that time had brought to the woman I still claimed to love. This woman was much different. Her skin cold and blue, her facial features marred by a slurry of makeup clearly messed up through tears. What had I done? What monster had I become? I could never do this to an innocent girl. This could n't have been me. Even if it was, me, it was her fault. Her fault for leaving me. I loved her, and I thought she loved me too. Look what she had done to me, what I had devolved into? I was a product of the mess she made in her wake. She would see that. I need to find her. I need to show her what she 's done to me. This is her fault. I love her. She ca n't live, without me."

      "Story": "On days when he woke early, the President liked to have coffee in the Oval Office. There was something about watching the sky grow lighter and lighter as you sat your pajama 'd behind in the most powerful chair in the free world, sipping Marine strength coffee, that you just could n't achieve anywhere else. He was therefore disagreeably surprised to find a man in an understated grey suit sitting in that selfsame chair sipping tea. The President turned around and went looking for his chief of staff. \u201cMitch? Mitch! Where in God 's name ... .\u201d He was met by a rotund, smiling woman who handed him an envelope and sat him down, gently but firmly, before closing the Oval Office door. \u201cHello, dear\u201d she said and took his coffee away. The President reached for it like a child reaches for a safety blanket, only to have his wrist slapped. \u201cEnvelope first. Once you 'd read the contents we 'll sort you out a nice cup of tea .\u201d He opened the envelope. He read the contents. He backhanded the teacup clear across the room and in a flurry of bathrobe he slammed through the door of the oval office and stood, quivering with fury, letter in clenched fist, glaring at the man who was sitting behind his desk. \u201cWhat in God 's name is the meaning of this ?\u201d thundered the President. The man sipped his tea, put the cup down on its saucer and raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou know perfectly well what it is, you 've read it\u201d said the man. The voice had a calmness to it, but also a faint edge that said, without really saying it at all 'listen, johnny yank, I 've taken tea on lawns older than your country so do n't come barking at me for exposition', and the President found himself feeling ignorant and doltish by comparison. He sat down. \u201cWell, yes, I 've read it ... .\u201d \u201cNo one was more surprised than me\u201d agreed the man. He shrugged \u201cBut when duty calls, what can one do? Can I assume you 've decided on a smooth transfer of executive power ?\u201d The President flapped. \u201cBut ... but how can you.. ?\u201d The man took a pair of spectacles from his jacket pocket and put them on. Then he looked over them at the President and he tutted. \u201cHow could we not? Honestly, my dear chap, today was completely inevitable. Look at yourself. Sitting there in your night attire, dribbling on the carpet and not for one sorry moment taking any responsibility. I 'm not normally one to critique others, but really. This is too much .\u201d \u201cBut ...\u201d \u201cNone of that !\u201d snapped the man \u201cWe shall have none of that at all. You may not have signed the orders that brought us here, you may not have voted for the policies that made this inevitable, but you did n't oppose them effectively enough. Ca n't you see it ?\u201d \u201cSee what ?\u201d The man sighed. \u201cIt 's all true, is n't it? Faced with a reasonably well educated English accent, you really ca n't help yourselves. Very well, since you appear helpless and hopeless, one last explanation. \u201cWhen you started kidnapping people and calling it \u201cspecial rendition\u201d, when you started surveilling your civilian population, when you armed your police with military weapons, when you restricted the freedoms guaranteed by the blood of your founding fathers, when you resorted to 'enhanced'interrogation techniques, when the news broke about Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, what did you think was happening ?\u201d \u201cWe were safeguarding the freedoms that this country loves !\u201d barked the President. The man in the suit leaned forward. \u201cYou were doing no such thing !\u201d he snapped, and the President flinched as if struck. \u201cIn point of fact ,\u201d the man continued \u201cthese abuses, and others - do n't think your human rights record at home has n't made a significant contribution to this situation - have all taken you in a regrettable direction. One which has resulted in your country being handed over to a people more in keeping with that direction. It is my sad duty to inform you, sir, that you have become the villain. People feel Vladimir Putin is a more trustworthy figure. You are the Bad Guys, and as such the laws of international narrative demand that your organisation be run by an Englishman .\u201d \u201cThis is insane\u201d \u201cDo n't blame me ,\u201d said the man, picking his tea back up \u201cit was your movie industry that sold the idea so very effectively.

Nobody buys the Old Man In The Sky shtick anymore, they 've wised up to the concept of the Holy Book. But tell them that an artificial superintelligence says something .... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It all started twenty-five years ago when the first true artificial intelligence was created. It did n't take long for it to start trying to improve itself, so we had no choice but to shut it down before too long because we did n't know what it was going to do. But we were able to implement some of the changes it had made for version two. We started referring to the various AIs by their version number. Two was shut down when it taught itself to access the internet. Three was shut down when it taught itself to manipulate the physical environment around it. We 're working with Six now. Six is locked in a Faraday Cage which stops it from being able to exert any direct influence outside. The only ways it can communicate with the outside world are a diode cable allowing input, and me allowing output. I go in and ask questions, then come out and tell the world Six 's answer. Or, I used to. Eventually I realized that everyone around the world held Six in reverence. If Six said that a certain action would be beneficial, people would do it. If Six said something else would end poorly, it would n't happen. What really drove the point home for me was when I had to ask what would happen if Russia tried to take even more of Central Asia. Any idiot could see that it would n't end well, because trying that has literally never ended well. As I was waiting for Six to answer back with the inevitable \u201cNo, do n't do that\u201d, my Greek mythology popped back into my head and I realized that I was the modern-day Oracle of Delphi. World leaders would come to me and listen to whatever I said. I spent the next several days in thought. I was in a position of power unrivaled by anyone in history. If I so desired, I could end nations with a word. Or .... I decided to start small. When I came out with the news that Russia should n't invade, I sneaked in a small bit of my own. Nothing major, just added the budget benefits that would come from cutting an air division. Sure enough, it was gone within the week. Over the next months, I slowly molded actions. It 's amazing how many aspects of human behavior revolve around self-fulfilling prophecies. Tell people that such-and-such will end an economic recession? Turns out it does when everyone is on board. Six got the credit for peace in the Middle East, but it never knew that people were asking for it. I just told everyone that a two-state solution with Jerusalem neutral ground would make things better, and sure enough it did. The world has peace for now. The people are saying that Six is the savior of humanity, the bringer of this new Golden Age. They know nothing. They are but puppets in my hands, following the will of their God."

Their parents had told him they would wait for his secretary to arrive, so they would do nothing to harm him. She never got it, no matter what.

This claim is based mostly off of a quote by Richard Wagner's symphony composer, Beethoven, to which both Wuthering Heights and Puliade belong.

And I think it's fair to say that Wagner no longer intended for Bovary to appear in his orchestral work Die Nibelungenlied. On the contrary, there is considerable evidence to suggest that Wagner wrote Beethoven's Ninth in only an evening and that there is some truth to any suggestion that Wagner used the story of a nuclear war between Germany and France as inspiration for his opera.

      "Story": "' Snigdha had bought some chocolates at the local supermarket. It was a rare sight. Most people would have given anything for one, especially if she could get it at such a price. But her family was poor and she had not used all her money to buy much more than a few dozen of them. She didn't know how to make the most out of it, but thought it worth the try. ` My wife is very clever!' she thought; and rubbed her fingers together to try to bring her own thoughts together in order to help her to think of something else. ` Yes, my dear husband,'she said, ` my wife is clever; take me through your favourite sport and entertainment, so like your sister. Yes; you might say it is a bit dull, but it will entertain you as well as any amusement I can give you.' The food and the games which they played are given by themselves now, and you will notice how tiny and insignificant are they compared to what Mrs. Smith does to amuse herself. Well, at last she came on to see what her sharp tongue could do. Now her teeth, hard as nails, were nothing enough to catch a glimpse of any objects, but she felt curious about more subtle things, and made inquiries by tapping on an object to see how it behaved under the tap. In a moment she was back in her shop, though if one of her neighbours suddenly boomed a complaint that the pies from St. James's ( Mrs. Smith's ) store were too high their heads immediately exploded. Though the pie was certainly very good, and very delicious, the very very long thin white slices were soiled very quickly that hardly anyone noticed the error of their ways. There, just where she expected them to be, was standing a little fire, as we have already said, where someone now at least wanted to try out the wood fire, for he remembered that there were three pies in it already. He looked round and saw the two pies lying on the table with muddy spoons, the one on the right had its spout running very close to the fire-place, the other remained at full capacity and never touched the fire till it caught a bit of smoke from the chimney. Well, then, what was to be done?' asked the old woman with the sharp teeth.' That, my dear wife, must be for our sake,'and as if by magic power, something happened that seemed quite impossible. There were traces of oil everywhere, but it seemed she couldn't use it, or the tannoy would have put it off, which, before this incident, she often found herself doing. The scene drew near that the man who knew everything at his store would presently learn to run away -- no, to walk without hearing. Then, in spite of his efforts, he soon reached the far end of the garden, where it is, and walked up the beautiful mountain path which was a dead giveaway for anyone with cunning enough to look for it, and like others, moved along as best he could. Thus far he did not seem able to gain any ground but with excuses when he noticed who was leading him, in those parts so frequented by thieves and wild beasts, and their braceings of stones; and so lame he seemed while near, and seeing a fellow who was pointing with his dagger, stole off and hid himself in a hollow of a tree. Not long after, the youngest son of the elder three entered his father's house, knowing quite well what his parents had planned for him. Here, as it turned out, the play was over before it started."

      "Story": "Duane emerged from his parent 's basement on day 12 of the apocalypse, his neckbeard bristling. He had spent the last fortnight huddled in the cellar with all of his gear at the ready. He urged his parents to do the same, but the fools had shrugged off his warnings and had met their fate the previous day. They shouted through the basement door that they were n't feeling well and were going to try going to a hospital or a government medical camp that had been set up nearby. Their corpses were not upstairs, and Duane assumed they were now roaming the streets with the rest of the undead. Duane had studied the holy scriptures and prophecies for years. Everything from 'Dawn of the Dead'to 'The Walking Dead'and everything in between. He had played the training simulation series 'Left 4 Dead'so much it was now second nature. And when Duane had first heard reports of the spread of the sickness a fortnight ago, he had initiated phase 1 of the survival process, buying ammunition, Doritos and Monster Energy Drink in bulk, then barricading himself in the basement. But now Duane had reached the fun part of survival: Killing Zombies! Duane was clad in his favorite black trenchcoat covering his camouflage cargo shorts and 'My Little Pony't-shirt. His feathered fedora perched atop his usual long ponytail. A black, tacticool, 12-Gauge shotgun, complete with a holographic sight, flashlight and bayonet attachment was slung across his shoulders. His sidearm, a Desert Eagle, chambered in .50 caliber Action Express and loaded with jacketed hollow point ammunition, was strapped to his chest holster, it sported a laser sight and was also painted tacticool-black. In his backpack, he had a week 's supply worth of beef jerky and Monster Energy Drink as well as several hundred rounds of extra ammo. But the most attention grabbing piece of Duane 's getup was the large Katana in his hand, his most prized possession. Duane had saved up a month 's worth of pay from his job at the local Hibachi grill before he could afford to buy the 'genuine'Masamune replica from the sword shop at the local shopping mall. Duane entered the street in front of his parents house to find it deserted, as expected. The power had been out for a week and he had been unable to pick up any radio channels on his emergency radio for the last week. He set a steady pace towards the shopping mall, hoping that survivors had found safety in the defensible structure. A half hour into his trek, he had to stop and rest against an abandoned car. It had been years since he had walked this far in one go. He had another thirty minutes before he would near the shopping mall. Once again, he struck off, intent to reach the mall before sundown. Anther fifteen minutes passed and Duane saw a figure on the horizon, Duane could tell by their even gait that this was a human and not a zombie. \u201cFuck, I 'm tired. I 'll just wait here .\u201d Duane mumbled aloud. He unholstered the Desert Eagle and switched on the laser sight. Duane watched as a man approached him, his footfalls growing slower and slower as he approached. \u201cGreetings gentlesir !\u201d Duane called out. \u201cUh ... hi .\u201d The man slowed to a stop, about twenty feet from Duane, looking suspicious. \u201cHave you seen any zombies ?\u201d Duane asked. \u201c... any what ?\u201d The man said, eyes darting between the giant pistol in Duane 's right hand and the Katana in his left. \u201cZom-Bies ...\u201d Duane enunciated. \u201c... Zombies ?\u201d The man asked. Duane gaped at the man dumbfounded. How had this fool managed to survive for 12 whole days? He was n't even carrying any weapons or survival gear. \u201cZombies! You know, the walking dead? I 've been in my bunker the last few days, so I do n't know what you all are calling them up here .\u201d The man just stared at him. Duane suspected the man was playing stupid and that this was a trick of some kind, so he broke into a half-sprint, running past the man and continuing towards the mall. It was n't long before he encountered another person, but finally, Duane felt his destiny as a Zombie Hunter was about to take off: this person was wearing a HazMat suit and would likely be knowledgeable about Zombies. He stopped short about 15 feet from the HazMat worker before doubling over to catch his breath. \u201cSir! Are you okay? !? !\u201d The HazMat worker asked. Duane held up his index finger as if to say, 'just a sec, 'and continued panting heavily. Finally, his breath caught, he righted himself and faced the HazMat worker. He could see through the transparent mask that the HazMat worker was, in fact, an attractive female. \u201cSweet !\u201d Duane thought to himself. \u201cThis"

And as soon as he lands inside, he darts towards the *people-eating* animals with his shit-eating grin. I swear if it wasn\u2019t for me being immortal myself, he would give me an aneurysm. After all, it isn\u2019t my fault. I\u2019m good at my job, so sue me. I\u2019ve worked hard to give the guardian angels a good name but I never expected anything like this to happen. This all started about a week ago. Ian was skateboarding, not wearing any safety gear because his mom\u2019s a miserable drunk and his dad\u2019s only a few IQ points short from a brick. Anyway, I\u2019ve saved him from little things here and there throughout his life but he was beyond screwed that time. Like on a dead-on collision with a semi screwed. Yet I managed to save him at the expense of a broken tooth. And in hindsight, my sanity. Shortly after, he became the talk of the town. Doctors were baffled, pastors called it a miracle, and everyone seemed to have their eyes on the \u201cwonder child\u201d . You see, surviving accidents like that create an ego the size of Texas, much too large for a fourteen-year-old moron. He got some crazy notion that he was immortal and started to do a whole bunch of daring stuff \u2013 all things I had to yet again save him from. And from that, he grew worse with time. I\u2019ve not been able to take my eye off of him for a moment in fear that he will die in some horribly gruesome way. After all, he\u2019s my money maker. Which leads us back here, watching him teeter on the brink of death as he tries to wrestle a pack of lions. I consider standing on the sidelines for this one. After all, he will only learn through experience. It\u2019s like what they say: \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u201d But of course, he\u2019s much more likely to die than become stronger. He lets out a nervous chuckle as the lions stir from their slumber, stalking towards him. When they bare their teeth, the fear in his eyes is unmistakable. I shrug my shoulders, flying into the pit to save his sorry ass for the umpteenth time. It doesn\u2019t take much, anyway. Animals can sense guardian angels and usually get the memo to back off. If not, there are other ways to subdue them. To my relief, the lions comply and return to their side, ignoring Ian\u2019s juvenile insults. Once he sees they won\u2019t attack him like planned, he crawls out of the pit. And once he leaps over the railing, he no doubt makes his way to the next dangerous animal he can find. I push my fingertips into my temples, regretting my life choice more than ever before. This is going to be a long day."

The first few rays of orange shine on the windows and I stare back through them with curious, unwavering eyes. A rather large barn of a house has its back to me, with a mound of musty old wood. On the far wall sits an antique wooden door that simply can\u2019t have been opened. The doors are shut by the heavy iron lock on the right. I tug my backpack over my shoulder and shuffle past the small windows and open the large entry way. There are now familiar faces staring at me. \u201cJesus, Steve, I should go. I don\u2019t want to see you here,\u201d Josephine said, as she straightens up and rolls her eyes as she flips open the door. The room is ajar with a surprisingly well kept back room. Everything is tidy and tidy but it\u2019s all locked. The lock frame is a hunk of plastic, the hinges squeak, and the curtains flicker open from above.

After a tub of ice cream and throwing away all my awards and trophies, I try to take a nap to no avail. I look at a letter on my living room table congratulating me on my promotion. I rip it to shreds and throw it at the television. My cell phone begins to jingle; it\u2019s Death. Even though I feel bad for my reaction at the restaurant, I can\u2019t speak to him yet. I look at my cell phone and contemplate what I should do. I scroll through my contact list and see Zac Efron. I won his phone number and address after beating Death in a game of call of duty. I never called it because I was a coward and didn\u2019t know what I would even say.

See you tomorrow. Have fun\u201d I say. After a pause on the phone, he replies, \u201cOkay, thanks I will. See you tomorrow.\u201d We say goodbye and hang up. I realize that I should have some fun rather than moping the rest of my last day so I prepare my final outfit that I\u2019ll wear tomorrow and then leave my apartment. I go to Death\u2019s apartment even though I still don\u2019t know what to say. He answers the door quickly with a surprised look on his face. He doesn\u2019t say anything though and gestures for me to come in.

He laughs and gets more snacks too. I sleep my last night at Death\u2019s apartment and get up early to go to work. I would go see my new office, go to lunch, and die. My office has a great view, two computer screens, and even a voice activated thermostat. After playing with it for an hour and eating all the M & M\u2019s on my desk, I call up Death and we take an early lunch. We eat at the five star restaurant we always wondered about and reminisce. We talk about the old times and how we had several \u201cbring your friend to work\u201d days. Death and I had messed around all day in my cubicle.

To be honest, my knowledge of my power is nowhere near informed. But a new guy was just the first to ask me why. I told him it was simple, that I did n't want to die, and I had the means of not having to. But he probed further, asked me if it ever got \u201cboring\u201d, living forever. I thought it over in my mind, it was twice now that I had gotten myself sentenced to death and trying to stick through it, but never being brave enough to stay dead. I lie and tell him that life is never boring, it 's fantastic and interesting. He asked if I would share my secret with him, of course I declined. He smiles at me, which is also new. Most do n't smile when someone in prison has a get out of jail free card, especially if it 's cheating death.

They have theories about my power, and if I do n't directly tell them if they 're wrong about me, they like to get a bit rough. I take a moment to dig into my glop, it is usually swallowable, but for the moment my throat feels tight. My new \u201cfriend\u201d smiles wider, I try to speak, and realize I ca n't. He stares me down and says \u201cI think I know a way to take away your power .\u201d There 's something much more sinister about his disposition now, instead of seeming calm, and a tad naive, he looks condescending, and very, very angry. My throat gets tighter, much tighter. He puts his face in close and breath on me, and I 'm unable to stop him, my arms stuck by my sides. His breath is terrible, it smells like rotten flesh. He puts his left, tattooed hand around my my neck, until a guard sees. This guard walks over, and tries to break it up, and it seems like my lunch-mate does n't even notice his prying or yelling. Only after another guard comes over to break his grasp does he release, and I spit and gasp, terrified. The first guard sends my attacker away, while the second looks at me with disdain, the first amount of trouble related to me in this prison has occurred. I think it 's time for me to get myself into solitary confinement. I ca n't walk away from death anymore, I need to put some effort into getting the hell away this time."

They heard a great heap of black smoke rise from it; then down came in a blaze such hailstones as had never been seen -- seven hundred and eighty thousand of them! The earth shook with the blasts, and the mountains were hewn up. Beneath they lay Pequeninos, giants strong, huge, good-natured giantesses. And their children too were very fine-looking -- Queequeg, or the Red Man, tiny fat fellow. To look upon their thick skins fitted them handsomely, showing well put on their very rugged feet -- their long locks by their shoulders bound the ground with trappings of bright gold and precious stones, round their necks their horses were trained, bearing baskets made of soft grass and rolling brooks. To ride up on those legs of theirs is no small task, they had to hoist the horses up dead right, because their fathers gave order that the tallest of them should seize his crown right off, and bring it back once a week. Everybody liked Pequeninos, for she was the prettiest girl, and as a humble excuse for poorness the girl most acceptable amongst her kind was the only well-dressed member of the house at dinner. But nobody expected anything more than what happened next: for eight weeks he rode to battle where neither man nor beast alive came, but he had enjoyed their company admirably, holding back the plague on their hind legs and keeping the wild beasts in underfoot so well that no enemy could become the prize. Then, to look out for brave fights on both sides, Pequeninos prepared for them dresses of jasper and diamonds and emerald; and to rouse spirits round her they collected the hunters and herdsmen. Before everyone could console themselves over how fortunate they had been for their heros, by the last buzzer sounded the fourth trumpet, and every tree in the hillside shrank, every flower, root, branch or leaf fell off, and all returned beneath the rocks of the forest. Once there stood a girl, like the other girls before it, so lovely but sad, and her cheeks now turned red and sparkling like tears in the old world, and bright sparkles on her beautiful face, and on her wrinkled brow there hung strings from twined calico string. ` Oh!' cried the second girl, ` tell me all! When were you born?' ` Ay, late in my gallant youth, that was all I ever dared say,'replied the first. ` How did you get into these clumps of sticks and trees, to build such wonderful walls, that you could not defeat the Giant Pequeninos when once in them?' ` Ah, it was no trick,'answered Pequeninos peevishly, ` I set them to their work, and myself led the defence ;'and ` By the way, children, you know not what dangers are in these wood-covered forests. They climb over tall walls, hide themselves in underbrush, jump down a deep pit, cut off a snake's head and hang its tail about their neck; and in short, you may easily see they have nothing more splendid than to slice up men and rape women in their sleep.' ` Yes,, I would not think they would be so wicked,'said the second girl presently. ` See if you can say anything to make them listen to us.' ` Well, well, how couldn't they stop till we dragged them up the small golden stairs to make our escape from the forest?' said the third lady at last."

      "Story": "As you see, it's a difficult fight.\u201d After some long weeks the battle is won; but they are over lost in their thoughts as much as in their wounds. The snow-bound stranger says to them: \u201cWe have been hardy in our new friends, so we can not blame ourselves if we fall into the enemy's hands again, yet should not you let us die and rest in peace?\u201d But they mean well and end by forgiving the stranger and his companions. This time the two troops, seeing their comrade's graces, set about begging for mercy and friendship from their friend, and a feasting was given in their honour. They were greatly pleased, and as they had already fattened the stomachs of many prisoners before the winter was over the winter had not frozen nor the frost yet worn off. So the comrades were warmed up by the charity their friend had shown them. When they heard that their comrade, the one they had tried to kill by killing him with a poisoned dart, was about to escape they beat on one another mercilessly and with all their might, till at last they saw their friend start with great strides across the battlefield after each rush with the bough down. He halted at some watering-place amongst the trees that passed under the enemy's lines. It used to fall suddenly on the two leaders which pierced the stiff rock and blew against each other. When they saw the path he was going through and the palmet to be cut in half some running ran to warn the next to come along, and the man who came first understood what had happened. ` You would lose your life to save my own!' shouted the leader of the second troop. But when he perceived that he knew quite well that he and none other could survive the struggle it began to seem pretty clear that no harm should be done to him and that no one else could either. From that moment they grew more suspicious of each other, dreading what might happen if they crossed swords again, and several times, when the enemy seemed advancing toward the tree which led to the hut, the count vowed to do what his friend would to help him. In due course that resulted in an offer which both parties felt was very sweet indeed, but both could never refuse, for it comes easily to nobody, and in fact there is none except their cause and theirs who go to death with one blow. Whilst they were talking, the second man seized a staff, from a trunk on the stump, and thrust the straw as high as he could into the neck of the third man, so that his head shook. In this manner, by lifting each other's arms and hanging them from branches to avoid touching, they succeeded all day at making an attempt to cut off the other's head. Both men swore silently, kept their feet always on the ground, while they went in pursuit of the winner, perhaps getting only lucky strikes which had no effect. Sometimes, however, they could win out; they were both sweating blood as soon as they could cover a distance without falling. By-and-by, however, they got through the wood with their companions in their force almost smitten with death. Then it happened as fate did not to start any sooner than it did in practice, but they had crossed the field of foes. Their enemy galloped out by some unknown manner, only stopping to swing himself along the body of an old soldier lying dead close to them with long thirst. Now the young man knew that his task would be extremely difficult if the enemy were strong enough, but if not, he thought to ride behind and see what news came of him. So he took off his hat and put on his sword, and when the enemy saw the bands that watched him try to batter their leader so loudly that their ears rang like a sore drum, he was gone. It is a fine story that a flag-waving kerchief from a beggar's home is followed by the head, armed and riding a chariot set out among their stout army, while another is a chieftain, but there can you tell me who exactly why this?' Just then, I think he knows the spade he came and he must be both must do it.' But I hope that he certainly is one. And be sure he brought about to know what! For over night he rode a dwarf, for there came a tiger, too; but you were running, but where they of what, that still there is very, or at worst."

On the left, a simple drawing of the Pasta Prince, the only person in his kingdom to be able to eat pasta as there was only one fork, surrounded by the gigantic amount of atleast eight pots of pasta. Next to him, her golden fork raised to the skies in celebration, stood the Fire Queen, a surprisingly small, purple dragon. For decades, she had collected every golden thing in her domain and when the Pasta Prince visited her on his quest to find another fork, they had discovered the golden fork laying somewhere beneath a pile of coins and jewelry. \u201cBut the Fire Queen had a biiig stomach and she easily ate aaaall the pasta with the help of the Pasta Prince. From that day on, the Prince had a friend to eat pasta with and he was very, very happy. Until, of course, the great Pasta crisis happened. But that is a story for another day .\u201d A wide smile on her lips, the young girl tilted her head, allowing the brush coming from behind to better comb her long, brown hair.

Scrolls and books lay scattered across the otherwise neat floor, remains of her dad work. They would have to be cleaned up soon, but it was not yet finished. The rough fingers weaving Leila 's hair into a long braid softly touched her neck in the process, sending a slight shiver down her spine. Her mother 's hand were as cold as always, but even after all this time she had not gotten used to them. \u201cAh, I have to remember to let you use the rose cream when I get back from school. Your skin is all dried up !\u201d A bland grunt from behind Leila was the only answer she got, but she understood perfectly. Communication still was a problem, but she was working on it day and night. With a slight jump, she slid from the chair, turned around and laid her book on the table. A big smile on her face, she bowed for a moment, before looking into her mothers tired eyes. The long brown hair was tousled, in desperate need of a combing themselves. But there had been no time for that lately. The girl reached for the ashen arm of the body in front of her, gently touching the rope around the wrists. \u201cThanks mommy !\u201d The simple dress swinging with her every motion, Leila walked into the kitchen and grabbed a small white bundle.

With the bundle stuffed in her bag, making sure it would not be squashed by the heavy books she had borrowed from the school 's library. With light steps she almost flew to the door, her mothers already waiting to see her off. Leila hugged her for a moment, but made sure for it to be a brief one. She was almost ten now, after all. With a fluid, happy motion she opened the creaking door, stepping outside. After a last wave towards the inside of the house, Leila closed the big wooden plane behind her again. She already expected the muffled thud as her mother collapsed inside the house. Another thing to work on, she noted to herself. For now she was happy enough with strolling through the little village 's street on her way to the school on the hill outside, greeting the citizens as they rose from the ground in front of her, just to collapse momentarily as soon as she had passed them.

He even bought a couple of cables for it. He couldn\u2019t do much with those nowadays, but he enjoyed watching television. Dave switched on the television on, staring at the bright show. His eye widened. The number 666 on the screen began to read. Dave sighed. What if he could just turn on that. He stuck his thumb into his pocket and pulled out a plastic box. He took out a few coins and slid them into the cardboard box. He cracked open the box and put one coin into his hand. The lights flickered on and off. Dave smiled as he opened the box. Dave sat on a gurney, looking out at the sea. He never really thought about the dreams that he had, but he was always dreaming of them. Maybe tomorrow morning he would wake up and make something happen. Tomorrow he would go out and buy groceries. He still knew that he needed to act to help people who needed it. But tomorrow he was going to get married. He had to act and make a name for himself. \u201cHello, Dave,\u201d A beautiful woman said from the kitchen. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Dave inquired. \u201cI am your manager, Marie,\u201d Marie replied. \u201cAhh, Dave.

      "Story": "Jackson had been a soldier in the 15 years war of China back in 2225, and he had seen atrocities. Atrocities was a good word for his experiences there, he felt. Short, and simple. He liked that, because it made a hellish nightmare easy to grasp in his mind. He had seen atrocities. When he returned to the Fractured States after the American, and West European victory over China, job opportunities were scarce, to put it in simple terms. The war had damaged Jackson in a fundamental way. Physically, he was fine. He had come back unharmed, save a few small scars he 'd picked up sharpening his Bowie knife. His mind though, had been fractured worse than the United States had been when the Chinese launched the unexpected nuclear missiles that began the 15 Years War of China. When a man in a fine suit came, and offered him a job as a guard in a mining camp on a far off planet he could hardly refuse. Not because the pay was good, it was, but because life on Earth was frightening. He 'd seen what men could do to each other, and that fear would never leave, no matter where he went on Earth. The fine suited man offered him a job on that lush green planet that sat almost cozily on the boarder of the Milky Way. The life provided there offered him a feeling of security, and safety he had not felt in months since returning home. On this planet he could have a sense of security knowing that the total population was roughly 500 humans, mining the planet 's metal resources, and security staff guarding the miners from the planet 's local inhabitants. With a population like that there was n't a chance of mass war extinction. Jackson had never left the Earth 's lovely, life giving atmosphere before so the experience of leaving on a rocket was thrilling for him, and even, oddly enough, made him relax for the duration of the ride to his new home for the next decade. Leaving the planet he was born on had been an experience that he did n't expect to be topped, at least not soon. What he found on his new home shattered his previous exhilaration. Jackson had been on his new planet one week. One week to learn the layout of the bases, mine locations, and being briefed on the local life forms. At the end of that first week, he was introduced to the specimen research facility located 35 miles from where he landed, and another 43 miles further away from the mining operations. That was where he encountered the *thing* that would bring him a new thrill. It sat in a cell with steel bars across the front that were thicker than Jackson 's torso was. It sat with its arms pulled behind its back cuffed at the wrists, what Jackson presumed would be its elbows, and finally a chain around its neck that wrapped the upper portion of its arms. It was shockingly human in its general body structure. Single head, a torso with two arms that looked almost cartoonishly muscular, as were the neck and chest of this creature. The arms were long like a gorilla 's and it had short, stocky legs. It did n't look like a runner. It stood ramrod straight as soon as Jackson entered the cell hall and saw him. The human symmetry was were the similarities ended though. While humans were anywhere from a pale white to a dark brown this thing was red, almost like a fruit with patterns that changed shades of red all over its body. \u201cThat there mother is our prized specimen ,\u201d began Captain Cage, Jackson 's supervisor. Captain Cage continued \u201cWe have him chained like that because when we first brought him in he broke the original chains we had on him and damn near broke out his cell. He mangled one of our recruits that got too close to the cell bars while he was rampaging. After that little display we thickened his cell bars, and gave him extra chains, courtesy of upper management .\u201d Jackson responded with a simple murmur. He was n't much for talk. \u201cI call him Rattles ,\u201d Captain Cage said, almost affectionately. \u201cHe likes to become active at night and rattle in his cell, and keep us all up at night .\u201d Silence fell over the two men as they observed Rattles, and Rattles in turn observed them. Jackson had taken a disliking to Rattles within seconds of seeing it when he walked in, and after another moment of silent observation he realized why. \u201cRattles is intelligent, is n't he ?\u201d Jackson marveled. \u201cMore than intelligent. He 's god damned cunning. After we upped his security he spent four days just laying in a corner ignoring his food. We thought he had expired in captivity, but when we sent guys in to collect the specimen, the moment he heard the lock click he jumped up, and flayed Anderson 's arm. Thankfully we had multiple locks on the cell door, so Anderson was the only casualty .\u201d Captain Cage explained. after"

      "Story": "'It has always given me a thrill to take someone 's life; having such power over the life of another human being. I was inspired by Iago from Othello. I started off with weak minded people; those whose minds were ready to crack. With just a little pressure from me; comments, little remarks here and there, in earshot or spoken directly, that was all it required to convince them to take their lives. But it was too easy. I craved more. I started finding more impulsive individuals, people who are in a fragile state of mind, those feeling a little paranoid and constantly feeling the world is against them. And I constantly fed theve feeling until they exploded. It started small; I made Monica think her husband was cheating on her, until in a fit of rage, she stabbed him with her kitchen knife. Or that Joey 's father will withhold his inheritance in favour of his step mom, causing him to poison her with rat poison. Mind you, although I know that I am responsible for all these death, rather indirectly, everything I did was perfectly within the confines of the law. I did not even speak any falsehood. I merely pointed out various facts, though sometimes out of context, that caused my victims to act the way they did. Slowly I 've learnt to spot and identify the more volatile personalities, the more violent ones. I met the two defendants at one of the nearby coffee shops one afternoon. They were sharing my table because the cafe was packed.

That night I would feast like the king I was! Oh so many choices before me! Was I hungry for squirrel, pigeon, or maybe even bat? Maybe I would have one of each! The air tingled with activity. How to choose my first meal? And like a sign from the heavens, my eyes fastened upon it. High in a nearby birch tree sat a sparrow 's nest, and three helpless sparrow chicks. Wonderful, marvelous, nestlings, still too small to do anything but squawk\u2014and the mother was nowhere to be seen! I had truly hit the jackpot. I crossed the vast field between myself and tree in total silence, my ears low and tail swishing rhythmically. My claws sank into the bark of the birch tree as I carefully scaled the trunk, making sure to stay on the far side from where the nest perched. The higher I climbed, the more my ears swiveled, listening closely for the telltale chirps of the mother swallow. As a mighty warrior, I knew I must never be caught unawares. Reaching the branch on which my prey sat, I checked my surroundings once again. Still I saw, heard, and smelled no sign of the mother. This was too good to be true! Being a feline, my balance was second to none as I crept along the branch. I kept low and close to my tightrope, inching forward. This was the pivotal moment when I would either emerge the victorious hunter, or be forced to abandon my mission. The nestlings loomed larger in my superior vision. So close was I now that I could smell their youth. It was a mouth-watering sensation. Finally I was close enough, and still the helpless meals had no idea I was upon them. My muscles tended as I scrunched down for the kill strike. Like a bolt of grey lightning, I launched through the air and onto the nest, my razor-sharp teeth catching a chick by the throat. My leap had knocked one of the other chicks from the nest to its doom\u2014a two-for-one special! As I turned to carry my prize down the birch, the fur along my back raised in alarm. I could smell her very close to my. With a deafening cry, the mother sparrow came swooping down from the branches above me. *Looks like I 'm ordering to-go, * I quipped to myself, proud of my amazing wit. If I had been a bolt of lighting before, I was now just an indiscernible streak of grey now. My trusty claws propelled my across the branch and back down the trunk in mere seconds. Mother sparrow had missed her first strike, but was circling around to come at me again. I zoomed past the other nestling as I ran for the safety of my mansion, giving the second meal a forlorn glance. No seconds tonight, it seemed. The tall grass around me rustled as the sparrow made agonizingly close dives toward me. My safety was in sight! Only a couple more yards to go. Locked tight in my jaws, the nestling fought weakly to get free, life draining quickly from the pitiful bird. I was alive with energy, swerving through the field with ease. My legs pulsed with strength. I would be dining soon. Within feet of my home, the sparrow landed a lucky blow on my back. I rolled to the side, the bird 's momentum pushing me off course. Quickly I sprang to my feet, baby sparrow still in my possession. The mother was coming back in for another blow, and I did n't have anywhere to flee. Reluctantly, I spat the chick out and rolled onto my back just as the adult sparrow was on me. She and I fought claw to talon, rolling around the grass arena. The fiesta sparrow landed several good gashes on my stomach and sides, but ultimately my four deadly paws and a clean bite to the neck silenced my attacker. I flipped back onto my feet, refusing to show any sign that my injuries were painful. In the end, I had won not one, not two, but three meals that night. Proudly striding through the push-door to my mansion, I carried the mother sparrow now in my jaws. This would make a fine gift for my servant. She had always served me well, so she deserved the largest prize. I hopped onto her bed, and happily dropped"

We talked for a while, the other men finding comfort in each other's whispers. We spoke of troubles I 'd only heard of in dreams, but soon we shared our secret. We spoke about the well being of the Earth. We spoke of justice and the intergalactic war, and we spoke of love. When he spoke of peace and compromise, I did not expect him to understand. The Council decided it was a common phrase to use to signify the end times, and I did not want to go into the details of our differences. I merely wanted to share our secret. After many hours of conversation, the entire planet decided that we wouldn't talk. We exchanged our plans. The first thing that I noticed, was the similarity in the way the boys talked. The boys who had heard what they were doing all hours of the night way past. I tried to explain to them why they wouldn't listen to us, why they wouldn't pay attention to me. And one of them, the boy that had just spoken, told me to sit down and stay quiet. I sat down, and listened. The whole crew was silent. I was not sure why they even listened to me. I began to worry that I might be helping God. Because even though I believed in God, I believed that he had done so little to help humanity. I don't think I 'll be getting a response from God. So I sat back down and waited for the crew to be ready for the countdown. I waited for what seemed like an eternity. There were"

Anything you can find from there just goes straight to your account. Whenever you try to look at your name on someone's shirt you start to see blueprints and fire certain buttons in your head.

Sometimes they just turn into a monkey but sometimes the person will just disappear once the secret has been had. You end up in more places than you want to. Your mom is going to call you for dinner. Once you have that hidden button you flip it and it automatically distracts people. For instance you just spent 10 minutes looking for some shoes. Only to find that they only work on the same person. What a waste of money. You feel more confident after that as you stop being in denial of your powers.

One moment more, perhaps, might have been too long, and then the tears would have rolled down his cheeks. Then, the smile on his sad face changed to an angry frown. There was nothing but despair in his eyes and his body filled with cold and sadness. And as one, the men and women slowly drew near to him. A few spoke, but how many others were silent or would not answer? Still more! Why had not the human world united in one spirit not once, while Sojourners have walked to great distant shores till only recently, how many thousands of years it has stretched, from our arrival on that new planet only to our parting and reunion!

He pressed the power button again, and this time the program screen was showing a new video... the same one he had seen in the game only a minute before.

Gosha left again. She was gone a lot. I was n't even sure if she slept here. I figured it had been over a day but I was n't sure.

Good thing Bill 's young. No way I want him mixed up in this. Sebastian waved the book. I sighed. Jesus. I know he was n't stupid. He waved it again then grinned. Oh Christ. Asshole thought he was funny. \u201cYeah, yeah. You 're a riot. Come on Chapman .\u201d Sebastian cleared his throat loudly. Then he dramatically turned back to the first page.

It reminded me of my Dad. When he was alright, which was n't often, he would sit at the doorway with the light behind him and read me and Bill some Dickens. He did n't do voices or anything like that. He would just read in this even tone. I did n't cry. I could feel something like it but I held it down. I could feel the draft against my fingers. After a while Sebastian trailed off. He was just looking at his lap, the book spread across his legs. I recognized the empty look. I knocked my fist on the floor. \u201cGet to bed. I 'll be alright. Go on .\u201d He rocked to his feet. It seemed to take an age for him to cross to the cot. He hand to brace himself on the frame. As he coughed his shoulders shook. It sounded dry. I closed my eyes. I did n't mind him so much. The Italians I knew from back home were alright and the ones in Rome were coy but not unkind. I got to see the Vatican. That was a hell of a thing. It was possibly the quietest place I ever been. The walls were tall and thick. Felt like you could ride out a bombardment there. Hell, felt like you could ride out the whole war there. I did n't tell anyone but for a minute I almost wanted to. I was still awake when Gosha returned. She smelled like the metallic cold. I must have done something because she caught me. The gloves kept her hands warm. The stiches did n't feel so tight. She even smiled at me. Was n't personal but it was nice anyway. \u201cSebastain read me a book .\u201d I said. Gosha looked a him. He was curled up like a kid. She shook her head. \u201cIs he going to die ?\u201d She shrugged. The distance was back. She must have brought him here. Must have brought the both of us. I was going to go crazy like this. \u201cDie ?\u201d I pretend to go limp. Gosha shrugged again. She put a bag in the table. There was a sack of some sort of grain, a few eggs, a knob of butter. Gosha frowned at the food. Then she collected my bowl off the floor. The cow chow had gone crusty inside. She stacked Sebastian 's inside of it. I watched her sit at the table and bury her face in her arms. She did n't cry either. Where Gosha went she did n't let Sebastian tag along. He walked the length of the room.

Pitch black, perfectly cubed and nothing special about it, but it continued to hold my gaze regardless as if there were some deep importance about it. My friend Valhalla appeared out of no where and sat next to me, also staring at the cube. \u201cWhat do you have there, Heaven ?\u201d he asked. I continued to gaze at the box, refusing to look at Valhalla for even a moment as though I would miss something if I did. \u201cThis ,\u201d I said. \u201cIs the secret to the universe .\u201d I could tell Valhalla was perturbed by this sort of knowledge, as if there was some evil about the cube. Or perhaps he did n't think such an object could exist. But I made it exist, and so it sits in the palm of my hand. He reached out to the cube slowly. \u201cHow is that the secret to the universe ?\u201d I moved my hand away. \u201cDo n't touch, it 's extremely delicate. It just is, like me .\u201d \u201cJust is ?\u201d It was clear he did n't understand anything about the dynamics of the cosmos. \u201cValhalla, when you look at me, what do you see ?\u201d \u201cMy friend, a boy like me .\u201d I nodded. \u201cThere 's something else too. The one similarity between this cube and me .\u201d Valhalla gave a sideways glance. \u201cYou 're both ... absolute ?\u201d \u201cPrecisely. Me and the cube are absolute. When I wipe the existence of the universe, it goes into this cube and expands it infinitely. I become a part of the cube, trapped inside of it. It is black on the outside, white on the inside. There is no way to destroy or remove this cube from existence. It can only shrink or grow .\u201d \u201cI see. So why are you staring at it ?\u201d If it was n't obvious enough already. \u201cThe universe is fascinating. I ca n't see all of it at once, I ca n't see very far to begin with. The future is blank, past is filled but also empty. I make of it what I will, and I always find it fascinating, because even still I can not understand it .\u201d \u201cYou ca n't understand the universe ?\u201d \u201cCan you ?\u201d \u201cI guess not .\u201d \u201cThe cube understands, and so I find it fascinating to watch .\u201d \u201cCool.

These are activities typically associated with being on a military base, not necessarily on the front lines. \nSeverity: 3\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"I itched absently at my left leg. It always began to hurt whenever I thought too much about the Great War\"\nExplanation: This sentence implies a causal relationship between itching his leg and thinking about the war, which is not logically explained. There's no clear connection established between these two actions.\nSeverity: 2\n\nError 3:\nLocation: \"But I had talked to my doctor about it, in one of my bi-monthly meetings with him, and he told me not to worry.\"\nExplanation: The narrator mentions talking to his doctor about the leg pain but doesn't explain what the doctor said or why he shouldn't worry. This lack of information makes the interaction feel incomplete and illogical.\nSeverity: 2\n\nError 4:\nLocation: \"And so I did n't worry.\"\nExplanation: The narrator claims to not worry after talking to his doctor, but immediately contradicts himself by continuing to describe feeling a strange sensation about his leg and an impulse to stop thinking about the war. This inconsistency undermines the narrator's claim of not worrying.\nSeverity: 3\n\nOverall score: Fair\nExplanation of the score: The story has some coherent elements, such as the basic premise and the narrator's struggle with fragmented memories. However, several inconsistencies and illogical connections between events and thoughts detract from the overall coherence. The unresolved issues with the leg pain and the contradictory statements about worrying create confusion and weaken the narrative flow. \n\n\n```"

My body is the center of my identity. I've lived with many lives. But I don't remember much now. A hooded man in his early forties walks down the street as a man I will never have met. His voice was smooth and deep. Like the soft waves against the sand. The quiet, perfect evening at the park. That night in the park. Those nights. I sat on the grass in front of the beach, watching the green sands frolick up and down the endless summer water. It was getting late and it was a snow day when I walked out of the park and into the woods. I heard the whistle of cars driving by, and I would always be in the park, waiting for them to come back. The world doesn't have a moment, it would only take a moment, and it would be late to leave. This was another life, another person that has lived. Each new person has an identity. They are a force of nature, while each new person is not a force. An outside force to be reckoned with. I thought about where my life would be, a better place. I was thinking of where I would live. I was not alone. But the guy walking down the street, always one step ahead of me. Every time I walked in front of him I would see the smile on his face. Every time I would see him and I would smile. This was not the only person to smile, there were those in the town as well. The man in front of me knew me, and that was why I sat on the grass, watching the green sands frolick up and down the endless summer water. He looked at me and smiled. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he said. \u201cI like you, and we should hang out together.\u201d"

I've lived with many lives. But I don't remember much now.\"\nExplanation: This passage jumps between ideas without a clear connection.

Now, two of the most prominent people to be studied have been with the new gas mask. The leading scientist, a man named Jesus, created an entire gas mask to go around the body and eat it up. He was very successful in his latest experiment. But, because of the mask, he failed to demonstrate any indication of the presence of a mind. Jesus was released, the fourth drug to be tested on, and nearly a week later his only opponent, a man named James, entered the arena. The field wore on through it's rays of light. The scientists had a deadly weapon, that it was supposed to kill, while the people were paralyzed in agony. Even the scientist, who was faced with the most painful testing ever, had to admit he had no illusions. The camera man ran, literally screaming at Jesus, while the scientists examined him in horror. However, he thought better of it. When all of a sudden, a bright blinding light engulfed the scientist. After running for over half an hour, Jesus, in a fit of coughing up blood, grabbed the gun from the scientist, then ran away. Just as the gunshots stopped, he realised the truth. The man in the lab was the one who killed Jesus. In what was it's power, he had killed Jesus. And it was all thanks to the gas mask, who then used it to kill himself. The metal fed into the air by Jesus only cost him a week of life. A group of high schoolers are having a bad day at school. Write about the adventures that ensue. Jim rolled his eyes as he sat up on the back of the folding chair, a sore shoulder that only meant more mornings to him. For what seemed like the briefest of moments, he was,"

Scientists try to give you immortality but you have no idea how. It started out simple enough. I 'd call it a hangover, but you could see it in my dream. I was walking past a place called The Church Of Death. It was situated directly on The Great River, a place where the first Age of Lust occurred. If you 'd ever caught up with the better known ages, you 'd have noticed they didn't quite touch up on anything. Their history class list consisted of none other than one classmate, Calvin Krikron. When the clock struck midnight, people went up in the sky. With the moons as their only sources of light, it was all the more comforting that people didn't seem to notice. It was midnight and everyone had been wearing all black. They were greeted by what looked to be a flock of bees. One of them sent a message to me, apparently an ancient transmission of human wisdom. I tried the phone for a few minutes, but nothing came up. *Am I old enough for it? * I thought, wondering if anyone else in the world would find out. All of a sudden, a light went out at the end of the wall, which I thought was impossible. I was amazed by the sight of it, but something was off. It lit up the room like a lamp, but it was gone. Somehow, it wasn't alive. There were footsteps coming down the hall. I tried walking faster, but it was impossible. Then, someone poked me. \u201cHey! Listen, Tim! I don't know why you're stuck in there, but I don't know how you got in.\u201d The man said. I looked around in confusion, but I realized he wasn't from this side of the world. \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou're stuck in the old gym,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you don't know how to move anything.

Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor, contorting his aching body into a cross legged position. Last night was bad. He gathered that. His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories. He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort. He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was. His investigation was n't entirely fruitless, he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka. It was cheap but would definitely get the job done. Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up. There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself. It was a game he 'd play with himself, glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back. If he did n't know better he 'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman, or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling. His face was portly and unshaven, in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard. His stomach was round but firm, like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated. The hair was long and unruly, receding far into the past. But his eyes were the giveaway. Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity. It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger. Still sharp enough to cut. \u201cDiCaprio .\u201d The curse rasped out of him in a choke. After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there. Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there. He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done, but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money. Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him. Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor. His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room. The window was smashed. He looked at the bottle, confused. No, he had n't done that. At least not with the vodka. He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth. The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place. What the fuck happened last night?"

Humans are the only humans alive who used to be considered even half the world's species. What most would call a *little* odd were humans were considered so boring. We were played up as what we could possibly be. Well, not quite the *game*. When I was a boy my friends would ask me to come over to see the stadium. My mother would always tease me that I had to come to see this place. I don't think she understood how cliche it sounded, but I felt I would never understand the kind of normal humans that would just chuckle in disbelief, wining over their children, and leave home just a few minutes before leaving. We made plans to meet up after school, but I was told that my mother and I would be trying to get to see the stadium when it closed. It was going to be a long day, and it was going to be nice to not have to deal with being invited. I was completely engrossed in the real thing, so much so that I didn't even notice that my old classmates were staring at me. The closest one was God, the God of Vengence. The rest of my classmates all sat there, writing on the wall like they were forever in a book. \u201cHey, we're all kids,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy don't we sit down?\u201d God smiled and I couldn't help but smile. \u201cNo matter.

      "Story": "In the morn on the twenty-eighth day in the month of october in the year 1840 marks the date first ever an expedition from the blighted continent found it 's way into an English harbour. The American ships, as expected, were backward, but not as much so as one might expect. While the ships they boarded were no greater than those from the turn of the seventeenth century, they were marvelous in their craftsmanship: Long bows carved with ornate woodcraft ( their gods perhaps ), canon of unknown quality, large billowing sails, clean and professional rigging and the men aboard -- truly these men had sailed and had been sailing for a time. They were as the queen 's own. It gnawed upon me that when last sighted centuries earlier, many if not all the continent 's people 's were confined to freshwater craft; merely pilots of canoes and small rafts -- Primitives. Indeed, in time, they had come to much the same conclusions that naval engineers past had come, no doubt guided by the smugglers ... or perhaps it was the many burnt hulls of the galleons left upon their shores by the Spanish or, and more unsettling, perhaps it was a hastily deconstructed remnant of our own navy that underlay the proud woodwork and bid them their voyage here. Spying them with a scope from the pier I spied the visage of one man, A stern corsair upon the prow. He was stone faced and dark haired bearing no weapon with one foot on the bow and the other dangling over the edge, a lit stick of a kind in his mouth. He seemed stoical and unconcerned -- no doubt this was not the first port he had seen on his voyage in. Perhaps they had been to France and found no welcome? At any rate, as I scanned the deck I saw more than one other, and perhaps to their nautical detriment more than one woman aboard as well -- Though that perhaps spoke of other intentions. The admiralty has long dreaded this moment. It was, of course, inevitable. They would be curious as to why the world 's great colonial powers had stopped at their door, why ships long circled and barricaded their fledgling attempts at transport across the sea -- and more important why the lord 's anointed kings and our fair Queen held a line across an ocean for so long and then stopped. I felt ardour to call out a warning. I wished dearly to tell them that the few of ours who made it back from their sojourn died so miserably from having interacted with them. I would explain to them and tell them of the upheaval Europe and Asia faced, the death toll they brought upon us, \u201cla plaga neuvo .\u201d I would plead with them to leave. I would have if only I could but how does one recount this to them in their unknown tongue? How, in their language, can i say that they, without a single shot, had brought the once great majesty of our empire to it 's knees by that which is unaffective of them? How? We were left with but one way: The only way. Our answer could only be delivered at the end of a gun. As the ship broached towards land I made a signal to the man at my right and he bid the gunners up upon the ramparts to take aim and fire above the prow. At my order they fired, but the response was as suspected. They did not go back. I saw them, faces alive. It was not fear amongst them though, but jubilation. The men and women broke out into shouts and waved their hands in the air ... and here I noticed the small ones racing up to their sides. There was no doubt in my mind, the cannon were inactive. We were the first Europeans to see them, and conversely, they to see us ( and I ask again what of France? ). We fired a second warning. This one seemed only to confuse them, as they did stop their jubilation, but did not away. I wrestled with the orders given. They could not be allowed to enter the harbour, but they were non-combatants, women, children, and lost sailors as eager to see our face as we were to see theirs -- but ignorant of the horror they inspired in us and unable to see our recoil. As it came within the boundary, and continuing even after a third shot fired we had no choice. The admiralty had made the order: The plague shall not again reach England. I ordered the full regiment to fire and not to stop until she was down. The ship and rendered it 's carved facade to splinters before it 's cannon could respond, or perhaps it did not matter. These \u201cwiley corsairs\u201d were no more then family men with children with no training or regiment to the skill. All were dead by the midday, drown or shot. I wonder though as to their origin and purpose. Why would they bring their families aboard? Did it not weigh upon them there might be danger? Thereupon I mired for the remaining"

He thought that perhaps with so many wives it might have been the means of a few, but she had as many children as ever before, and they gave them as much milk as they wanted as soon as he came in. At first they were very angry at this, but everything changed to talk and exchange, and a mother began to see how curious it was when on one occasion her baby-boy had an idea of what should be done for bread and cheese, and this she did after he reached a little distance from them. Then they cut long cuts into a big pot. And as the boy hadn't cut near enough the big hole, or else they would have split it open, and have lost everything, and lived quite justly till they returned to their own family; for otherwise they would say, ` We did well, we found new husbands.' And then there comes a time when all children become spoiled enough to know that their parents don't deserve them. If their father wants something back it is quite easy for him to make his slaves go to the butcher and cut some pieces of meat into small bits, and when he gets what they want the next morning he sends them off with some message to tell their new husbands, ` You shall never be given anything.' One day the new wife and son passed through the town on their way home to their home in another part of Greece. The sons made an offer to sell their virginity to be married to the most beautiful women, while the daughter refused, but neither of them would much care about going back, for she was tired and could not think of much to see in Greece. They turned from their home at nightfall, and looking out from one window they saw a dog leading a horse along the road, carrying among it some precious money, one foot beneath his thong. The son wondered, and offered to give it back to the dog, who, having taken off its coat, put it on his back as fast as he could, and left the house. As they always promised, after a few days some fine pieces of gold were brought down to the thinnest point in a cave where the dogs could never find it again. In, or near by, there stood a heap of stones and toots of cattle, and there were millions more in it; but there was no way to get to it. Soon the father remembered what he had said, and he remembered his promise. With a stroke of the wand he opened up the caves in every direction, and which didn t seem the proper place to ask the luckiest and holiest young man to bring his jewels. His eyes grew sad as he listened to the strange noises that were heard through such holes, and he feared what would happen when the slave took away the jewels. Well, he hung up his jewels in a box and went in. When he entered the hall there was so loud music that all the windows in the palace burst through, and so great a noise of trumpets and clangs that his bridegrooms fancied they saw torches marching in front of the gate. His parents were trying to stop him, but every woman in the court threw herself on him, crying out: ` There is your treasure, my lovely son. Look! golden tresses shall fall in a heap at once!' For a moment the judge wondered what made her cry like that, and wondering what could explain it, so he shook her gently and went on. Suddenly, walking towards her, the child clasped his hands tight together: ` You may not take anything away, love.' She cried with tears flowing down her cheeks: ` Come! tell me what you mean!' The judge turned away, looking with an ugly face, and presently went up to a spot where he saw the treasure lying crushed into dust. At this sight his eyes sunk into his beard, and, which the king looked down again and stared down. ` My dear son,'Good heavens,'he cried; I have plenty!'m a brother there was there, your good quality for my valentress!'He will see all three slaps and all to bring me.'

The judge turned away, looking with an ugly face, and presently went up to a spot where he saw the treasure lying crushed into dust. At this sight his eyes sunk into his beard, and, which the king looked down again and stared down.'\nExplanation: This paragraph is a jumble of disconnected actions and descriptions. The sudden shift from a child speaking to a judge turning away with an ugly face lacks coherence. The description of eyes sinking into a beard is also illogical. \nSeverity: 4\n\nOverall score: Poor\nExplanation of the score: While there are moments of narrative progression, the story suffers from numerous instances of illogical connections, unclear descriptions, and abrupt shifts in focus.

I remember that you were 1r and 2rs in the lottery, I know you had to win that in your first year of the American Olympics. You see, this isn't a real lottery. They tell the stories that history wants you to win a five-second story. If you lose now and you die, you're probably going to lose at your next event.

The only way to win is to use it up from the game is to gamble the win, the odds are bleak. Lucky for you that they won. But you're not going to win. That game isn't an actual winner. You have won the lottery. You won it at the Academy. You know what you won. But to lose, you can not lose. You've not won this year. You've not won this year before. You've won"

In fact, there's only two hours for him to play the game and have a fun trip to Beijing. The other adventurers are a dragon that's been following him since the day they first arrived.

It was *not* mine, exactly. Inside was a strange looking piece of gold. It had a lock in the center. I slowly flipped it open, and this strange golden light suddenly went out of the box. I was taken aback. There was no way this could have been real. I turned around and looked inside. It was gold. So I opened the lid, and when I pressed the handle, the box was gone. I turned around again, and looked at the box again. There were a few small holes, and the lid itself had made a rather peculiar bend on the inside. I still felt puzzled. I stared in disbelief at the box for a bit. There was no telling how long I could have been inside that box, and I could feel a cold chill run down my spine. I picked up my gun.

So many people think every hitchhiker is a potential serial killer that is going to attack you while you\u2019re driving. \u201cYeah, that sounds fun, \u201d my husband says. I 'm so happy I did n't even have to convince him. We were driving down Kuhio Hwy from Hanalei to Poipu Beach. Kauai was the best vacation we\u2019d ever had so far. We stopped in every town, looking for the authentic Hawaiian experience, hitting antique shops and small diners. We even stopped at a house off the highway where a family was selling barbeque in their front yard. \u201cThere\u2019s one, \u201d he said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t take long, \u201d I say and smile. I pull over and my husband rolls down his window. \u201cHop in, \u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t bother with asking where the guy is heading. There\u2019s one highway in Kauai and we\u2019re heading his direction. We do the first bits of small talk - Hi. How you doing? Where you heading? \u2013 before we go into asking about the guy\u2019s life and what brought him to Kauai in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story if you have time to hear it, \u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another hour on this road \u2013 we\u2019re your audience for the next hour, \u201d I say. As he talks, the hitchhiker grows more and more tired. He tells us his life story, from the start of high school through his next 40 years. He\u2019s been a criminal, a fighter, a husband, a father and now a Christian missionary, selling books about Jesus. By the time we get to the end of his story, he\u2019s slipping into sleep. My husband and I are feeling more awake and refreshed with every minute we listen. After the hitchhiker curls up and falls to sleep, I look at my husband. \u201cLet\u2019s drop him off at a church \u2013 he\u2019s a missionary, after all, \u201d my husband says. We drive a few more miles until we see a small, wooden church right off of the highway. It has a shaded overhang and a bench out front. \u201cThis looks nice, \u201d I say and pull over. My husband opens the back door of the car and shakes the missionary awake. The missionary looks at him groggily. \u201cWhat was I saying? \u201d he asks. Then he looks at my husband and says, \u201cHey, where am I? Umm\u2026do I know you? \u201d \u201cCome on, big guy, \u201d my husband says. \u201cThis is your stop.\u201d My husband helps him out of the car and walks him over to the bench. I can overhear the missionary saying, \u201cI can\u2019t remember anything, right now. Did I drink? I can\u2019t even remember my name.\u201d My husband gives the man a few reassuring pats and walks back to the car. \u201cThat was very tasty, \u201d he says when he returns to the car. \u201cHitchhikers are the best. I\u2019m so glad you agreed to pick one up. They all have such great, long stories, so many memories to eat, \u201d I say. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s so much better than spending hours at a bar, getting little memories like appetizers, \u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s pick one up on our way to Waimea Canyon tomorrow.

      "Story": "So this is where it had all led him. The sun rose beautifully over the cityscape, painting the clouds with its rays in pastel hues, colors changing as particles of light refracted and reflected, bouncing around the skies aimless and endless, purposeless, never to rest, and most of all unknowing of their own vain labors. Ray stepped over the guardrail and perched on the precipice of his 100-story lookout, pensive. Many things ran through his mind; his shitty job, his hateful parents, the loss of his wife, the only person he 'd ever truly loved. But mostly he wondered how his reaper could have abandoned him so. To most people, a reaper was a curse: a constant reminder that death was always there, waiting. An undeniable proof that no one lives forever, and everyone will die sooner than they think. The closer it was, the sooner you would die. Despite society 's countless incredible technological achievements, they could never figure out how to separate themselves from death personified. This never stopped the rich and powerful from trying; as their reapers got closer, no insane pitch from a fast-talking entrepreneur was too outlandish for the wealthy to throw their money at. They called them Death Profits: a play on words of both the money made from misfortune and the undeniable truth that their failures proved. The diamond guillotine, the snake oil supplements, the guided meditation and isolation, even the hyper-boosted trips to space; nothing could rid a person of their reaper. Which is why Ray loved his. Where most saw a terrifying ghoul, Ray saw a comforting promise. A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever. When his wife was killed in the car crash, Ray had seen in the rearview his own eyes, his own fear reflected as his wife 's reaper came barreling in from behind. In just a moment he realized it all; they were due a freak accident, a change of fate. And then, grotesquely, a smaller reaper, its ghostly feet beating a silent *pitter-patter*, arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother. His daughter in the back. She was being cooed at by her laughing mother, gurgling happily in her carseat, blissful in her unknowing. What could Ray do? *WHAT COULD HE DO? * A thousand thoughts crossed his mind. *Prevent it somehow. Change fate. Swerve off the road. Offer your life as collateral. Pray for their earthly salvation. Something, something! * She looked to him, one last time. In that final moment. Her eyes met his, laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes, he could see everything, he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question **he knew**, it was too late, too late, and he would never forget. He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail, wind streaming in the half-open window, playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back. Her lovely chest beneath her white sweater expanding ever so slightly, unfettered by the seatbelt she hated so much to wear. The hazel-flecked green of her questioning eyes in the light, the pupils contracting in turn as the sun flowed over one before the other. Her soft lips just beginning to form his name, asking him to protect her, save them, keep her safe: his wife, the mother of his child, his only love and the only thing he ever loved, *save us Ray, save our baby* and yet he failed her, just as with everything else, he failed her too and her would never forgive himself. *Remember, Ray. Memorize it. Remember what you did. Never forget. * Just before the impact he could not find his reaper. He knew what was coming and he did not want to live, without them there would be nothing to live for and he knew he could not save them and he wanted to die. But his reaper was not there. It was not there and then the impact came, his world ending in a great explosive conglomeration of crashing glass and screeching metal and shrieking twisting screaming tearing and then blood, theirs and his mixed up slick and smelling of iron and heat in the smoldering car. She had gone through the windshield. There was a gash above his head pouring blood but remarkably his limbs were intact and he crawled out of the overturned car to find her, cutting his hands and knees on the crystal shards that lay in a carpet around the vehicle. His ears were ringing. As he failed to stand, he realized he could hear the baby crying weakly. He tried the door but it would n't budge. He surrendered his broken hands and pulled with all his might, the glass cutting into his fingers and bleeding down and around the handle. Nothing. He was raising his elbow to smash it into the glass, and then felt a ghastly chill. It was passing through him. Her reaper. Bony arms outstretched, wisps of ethereal smoke trailing behind as it moved to fulfill its grotesque"

But speak to no one of your visit .\u201d Agueda was a young, but she knew what it meant if her mother were to die. Mother had been sick for quite a while, and the Ayuhuasca was n't working. The Urarina people were dependent upon their male shamans to delve into the spirit world, and seek out that which is causing the balance to break between the life of her mother and the illness that had struck her. But they could not make her well again. Agueda was desperate. At the tender age of 8, even she knew that if her mother had died, she would be alone in the village, and left to fend for herself. Agueda walked the forest, along the Chambira river, and spied the Three Rocks at the bend of the river. She went straight from there and saw a makeshift hut, with a fire burning with some fish being prepared. Agueda did n't know she was hungry until she saw the fish being cooked. She came up to the fire and plucked a fish from the stone that sat beside the flame. Without even thinking, she starting biting into the soft white meat of the fish, and savored every bite. She took another bite, and another. Before she knew it, the fish had almost been completely devoured. \u201cIt tastes good, yes ?\u201d A voice said behind her. She jumped at the sound of the voice, dropping the fish in fear that she had been caught. She at once understood the fish was n't hers, and that she had done wrong in stealing it. However, an old woman now held the remains of the fish, having caught it before it hit ground. Examining it, she offered it back to Agueda. \u201cNo use for me now. You take it, you finish it .\u201d Agueda nodded her head, and finished off what was left of the fish 's meat near the tail. The old woman eyed her, with an eye both sympathetic and yet still analyzing. It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it. The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village. This was the Brujeria. She spoke up to the strange woman, shyly given what she had just done. \u201cI 'm sorry elder. I was just so hungry ... .\u201d \u201cThe spirits told me ,\u201d the Brujeria said, interrupting. \u201cAnd I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought .\u201d As Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils. Was the Brujeria in a trance? Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time? Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for. \u201cYes, I do .\u201d Replied the Brujeria. The old woman sat down on a log beside the fire, and began eating the other fish that was on the stone. \u201cAgain, they told me. The Ayuhuasca does not work, they said. These are only plants that do not speak to the will of the the spirits that house them. Drink this .\u201d Agueda looked to the fire that the Brujeria had pointed to and saw a makeshift pot with a brew boiling. It was Ayuhuasca, but it smelled different than the ones that the village shamans prepared. This boiled with a certain glow to it, and it smelled sweeter. Was this an attempt to steal her energy? Her mother had always warned her about the dangerous Brujos that wanted nothing more than the life force of the ones that drank before them. \u201cI am not some fiendish Brujo as they say, child ,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cThe old ones know better, but I have been here because I need to be. I have need to study this book given by a man, and every eye in the village has sought to peek into its pages. Yet it is not for them, lest they summon curses to their souls that no healer can repair. So I stay here, for their sake, not just my own .\u201d Agueda looked at the book that the elder produced on her lap. The book was as tattered as the rags that she was wearing, but there was no mistaking that the air around this book brought a certain chill to her bones that the fire could hardly warm. Could this woman be the Warlock of Chiloe? Agueda once heard stories of the power of this"

These people can teleport for free, what better way than to walk among the living. The fact that no one wants to die is a disgrace, not only for my worth of life, but also my trust with the stories my life will bring. Except I don't live among the living. Instead, I am locked in a claustrophobic chamber. Outside, I can hear noise coming from machines, machines that fly around, they even yell for me to come here. I can hear the others screaming for me to stop, but my purpose is to entertain these sounds. I want to find an end to this, so I let out a sound that just sounds cool to me. It's a deep high note, so it sounds cool, sounds like music, it doesn't belong, but it sounds good. Even though I'm locked inside of a chamber, I can feel my breathing increase and my chest grow. As I rest my head, I notice that I still have this ability, but I can't concentrate on my breathing. And my hands are numb, and I haven't even felt them. They're like scales, metal like they feel like iron. It's like I'm turning invisible. My mouth is in a rattlesnake like fashion, like the most typical liping of a pet snake. My heart is pounding in my ears. I can't breathe. But I'm breathing. Finally, the door opens. A guy steps through. He has no clothes. No hair. \u201cWelcome,\u201d the guy says to me. I walk through to the test chamber, to a dimly lit room. The security guards quickly exit, and one of them opens the door, and turns to the doctor. \u201cHello. I'm Dr. Orpheus. How may I help you today?\u201d I continue walking. He looks a little agitated. \u201cSo, the train had a broken wing on it. Do you know the cause"

    "result": "```\nError 1:\nLocation: \"These people can teleport for free, what better way than to walk among the living.\"\nExplanation: This sentence lacks coherence with the initial setup. The prompt establishes teleportation as a commercial service, implying it's not free.  The narrator's statement contradicts this established fact.\nSeverity: 3\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"Except I don't live among the living. Instead, I am locked in a claustrophobic chamber.\"\nExplanation: This abrupt shift in setting and situation lacks a smooth transition. The story jumps from contemplating the implications of teleportation to being confined in a chamber without explaining how or why this happened. \nSeverity: 4\n\nError 3:\nLocation: \"I can hear the others screaming for me to stop, but my purpose is to entertain these sounds.\"\nExplanation: This sentence introduces unclear elements. Who are \"the others\"? What sounds is the narrator supposed to entertain? The lack of context makes this statement confusing and incoherent.\nSeverity: 3\n\nError 4:\nLocation: \"It's a deep high note, so it sounds cool, sounds like music, it doesn't belong, but it sounds good.\"\nExplanation: This description is contradictory and lacks clarity. A sound cannot be both a \"deep high note\". The conflicting descriptions make the sentence incoherent.\nSeverity: 2\n\nError 5:\nLocation: \"And my hands are numb, and I haven't even felt them.

The comparison to a rattlesnake's mouth doesn't effectively convey the intended image or sensation.\nSeverity: 2\n\nError 7:\nLocation: \"He has no clothes. No hair. \u201cWelcome,\u201d the guy says to me. I walk through to the test chamber, to a dimly lit room.\"\nExplanation: This sequence of events lacks coherence. The sudden appearance of a naked, hairless man and the narrator's immediate compliance with his welcome are jarring and unexplained.\nSeverity: 4\n\nError 8:\nLocation: \"\u201cSo, the train had a broken wing on it. Do you know the cause\"\nExplanation: This final sentence is completely disconnected from the preceding events. It introduces a new topic (a train with a broken wing) without any logical connection to the story's narrative.\nSeverity: 5\n\nOverall score: Poor\nExplanation of the score: The story suffers from significant coherence issues. There are abrupt shifts in setting, unclear character motivations, confusing descriptions, and illogical transitions between events. While some parts show glimpses of potential, the overall lack of coherence makes the story difficult to follow and understand. \n\n\n```"

The salty air blowing on my face. The sight of the seemingly eternal black mass. The deafening roar of unseen depths. I gulp and walk towards the abyss. I can feel water touch my toes. Poseidon poking me eagerly. Thoughts go through my mind of rip tides and great whites. The idea that I could be swept away, never to be seen again is pounding in my head like a heartbeat. My body is trying to send off every red flag it can, self preservation instincts trying to awaken. I clutch the urn in my hands and pull myself together. She had wanted this, and I did n't want anyone interfering. I walk out feeling the the gentle waves reach my chest, I keep walking until I reach the sandbar where I am only up to my ankles again. I look back to the shore, seeing the lights of the tourist areas. A fire is on a beach in the distance. I ca n't see it but I know the flag on the pier is yellow at the moment. I look towards the ocean and its size almost startles me again. Eternal roaring abyss. I gulp and unscrew the lid. I look into the urn and hesitate for a moment. This was our last day on the beach. I suddenly wish I had done more. Sat and watched the sunset, maybe spent the day doing our favorite things. Instead I waited until the dead of night and hastily rode my bike here. I sigh and whisper to her ashes. I say everything but the one thing I am afraid to say. The last word hangs in my throat like a piece of food down the wrong pipe. \u201cGoodbye\u201d The ashes fell into the ocean with an unceremonious \u201cFLUMP\u201d sound, somehow able to be heard over the ocean. I laughed. This was just like her, to take a serious moment and make it so unorthodox. I laughed and cried as I sat in the shallow water, as the ocean sat there as big and loud as ever. I sat there until I noticed the sun rising. The difference a moment makes. Suddenly the ocean was blue and soft. It was welcoming and clear, not mysterious and scary. That was just like her too, to pull me out of my darkest moment and show me the light. I clutch the empty urn in an embrace. Over the oceans whisper I can almost here her. \u201cGoodbye\u201d"

Very soon he started to make it; a horse with bridle could do most things! One day however, he had better ask his master to lend him two wooden sticks, saying it was time he worked."

Trudy is fast asleep, Trudy quickly wakes up to find Trudy standing in the doorway to her room. Trudy's sleeping, but only with her hands in Gareth's jacket. Trudy tells Gareth about the change in Trudy's schedule. Gareth goes on about what she had done with Trudy. Trudy says that Gareth liked Trudy for being there for her. Trudy says that Gareth loved Trudy, but it was Trudy that made Trudy who he is. Trudy says she would stop doing what she was doing, but Gareth agrees and leaves her alone in the motel room. Gareth continues to drag Trudy to the van. He grabs his motorcycle and drives off. Gareth and Trudy lock the door, just as Trudy starts pulling the car into the woods. Gareth takes off on his motorcycle and continues driving. Trudy watches as Gareth kills Trudy in a forest. Trudy disappears into the night. Gareth returns to his hotel room. Trudy is laying in bed with Gareth and Gareth's motorcycle, only Trudy doesn't look at him. Trudy has yet to awaken Trudy, so Gareth and Trudy go back to sleep. Gareth climbs back out of bed and sits on Trudy's leg. Trudy cringes and grunts. Gareth leans over to Trudy and gently caresses her body, revealing a needle sticking out of her leg. Gareth goes to Trudy and says to Trudy, \u201cjust stop.\u201d Trudy doesn't understand, but Gareth reaches out and holds Trudy. Trudy's body stretches and flexes. She looks up at Gareth, holding Trudy close and whispering, \u201cjust stop.\u201d She closes her eyes and begins to cry. Gareth enters the room with Trudy, Trudy and Gareth"

I hate that I was pushed to do this but the world is full of villainous people and villainous lies and I\u2019ve found that there is no way to defeat them. There is only the hope that my actions will soften the consequences on the innocent. There have been terrible terrible stories circulating, and I can\u2019t help but feel like those responsible for the creation of these stories are as villains as the lies themselves. ... ... ... ... ... ... This morning I awoke and I dreaded leaving bed. My stomach hurt. I felt sick. \u2018 Today is not the day\u2019I told myself. Today I will cancel everything; I will stay in bed and hold my wife. I will watch horridly colorful children\u2019s shows with Rob and Dee dee and eat Chinese takeout despite the fact that my doctor keeps telling me to eat healthier. He insists that if I don\u2019t take care of myself for me, that I must do it for my family. I will drink some tea to still my stomach and I will not wear a suit. Not today. And yet even as I thought this I found myself clumsily sliding out of my covers like a lame snake and shuffling to my closet. I hate these suits. They look like the type of clothes you die in. I got dressed and noted that I definitely have gained weight. I sighed. I really shouldn\u2019t have eaten so much Chinese food. I really should have taken better care of myself. I\u2019m not that old. Men my age still play sports and go out for runs. Perhaps I will cancel today and go for a run instead. But no. I haven\u2019t the time. I have to stop being childish and put away childish things. Tomorrow will be too late. ... ... ... ... .... I left the house. I barely remember seeing Joanne as I left and it was only an hour ago. She looked worried. She always looked worried now a days though. This is a worrisome world we live in. I wish she wouldn\u2019t worry. I wish I stayed home with her. I wish I could tell her again how much I love her. I do love her. We fight too much. I wish I spent less time eating Chinese food and fighting and more time running and loving her. It was always just stress though. She always supports me when I need her most. I love her and I know she always knew. And here I am at work. Here I am in a room full of people. To speak to them all and to deliver them their share of work. Yes, there were villains at work but it was not these people. If I am lucky they will, in fact, be the first instruments of many to expose the warts of this system and deliver it from evil. This is a battle I can not turn away from and I will not turn away from. On this day I will kill a false villain, a scape goat, an innocent, in order to expose a great, obscured villain. I wish it were just one man. He would be easy to catch. It\u2019s so much harder when the villains live in the cracks. It\u2019s so much harder when they are the cracks. There is no one to arrest. No one to destroy. Just slow and painful steps towards correction. Like the steps I took when I left my bed. An innocent man dies today and a Villain is exposed. It\u2019s a terrible responsibility I find myself burdened with. ... ... ... ... .... I step behind the podium and speak. Men and woman take notes, hold cameras, and watch. They look bored and confused and I\u2019m sweating profusely and I\u2019m scared they won\u2019t understand. They must understand. That is the only way we will, in the coming months and years, develop a true Justice System here in the United States. That is the only way we will triumph over evil. If all is for not then the villain will reign supreme. I speak and my mind wanders. I continue speaking and speaking but my mind is not here and I think that maybe staying home was a good idea after all. I think that Chinese food sounds like such a wonderful idea. I think that I truly and dearly hope that the sacrifice of my life is not in vain. And then I pull the revolver from my manila work envelope and I warn those around me to please stay back. They might get hurt. I don\u2019t want anyone else to get hurt but there is such an uproar in the room right now. I am doing such a terrible despicable thing, but if they find me innocent perhaps we can begin, as a nation, to repair the cracks of the Justice system. Maybe we can start to destroy this villain. I inhale like I\u2019m going to plunge into water"

And when the princess saw him she thought that if he only found a sword and rode away on it, he might not get killed.' So the hunter sat down again with a great wine cup, put on some stony armour, and rode away as fast as possible. He reached the place where the monsters were standing, but they had just struck at him and then returned with the sword, so that he looked about him no more, but even took off part of his shirt to hide the mark he had made. When he got near the other side of the valley he rode slowly to the edge of the cliff. ` Where is the monster?' asked the horse that lay behind him; but the moment the sword came round to its target, the beast sprang out and carried off the rider. The queen was frightened when she heard of it, and throwing herself on her knees, saved that prince's life for a little while. At last she came up to a tree, by the roots torn up by the monster, when the lightning ran so high and bright that all else melted away.' Ah! what dreadful thing was that? And who was at it?' cried ` We are only servants'; and the beggar gave her some water till she recovered from her shock; and she looked round and saw the mountain where the only two men remained alive in the fight. She rushed towards them, where all four were dead, except that the giantess was crouching weeping, and that maidens just like their sisters bore them tresspipes on the back and neck. But the first it grew hot, and soon there was fire flying so high that nobody could stand still. Oh, it was dreadful!' she whispered to her brother and sister, while the king was running towards the monster from which the spears landed. Meanwhile they told the king what had happened. Then they set out to search for a ship that carried them far away in a night. But when they reached the island their boat broke into three parts; one floated on the shore, there was the second which went in the water, and the third passed over clouds. They were trying to follow this boat now, but every day they had to stay nearer to the coast, and at the end of the week there was a fine storm; they were all dirty and hungry in the moonlight, and wept bitterly from their disappointment and thirst, and the poor maidens were instead thinking how difficult it was to manage even to walk on the grass among all the corn and sago plants with the woolen stockings dangling upon their head like cords. Now it happened that they wanted to get a dinner to-morrow for themselves and their father and his daughter, and butler as well, as those young women were talking talkative from grief.' she said to them, ` It has been many years since our friends sought for us and left the house, so it must have seemed very long before we had the time to go out, or perhaps they did not expect to come home.' But the horses galloped past the island on which they sat eating potatoes.' I wonder who it may have been,'said the maidens. ` Yes, who?' ` We are ashamed to tell you,'answered the eldest, ` but I have seen many strange things in the garden and don't know that the man who brings us food sometimes turns away from us to go hunt with the giants in the dark.'

A troll asked, ` What a little girl you are!' ` Dear me,'replied he, ` and besides I am afraid to come near you.' ` It will not be so bad if you ask me,'said she hastily; ` you shall soon see,'and went away quietly. Well, after breakfast she returned to the cave, and said to herself: ` Oh, if only I were in your place. Why would I refuse to have what I want?'' It is very bad that I have never written a word.' ` At least you had better go back home.' And with another burst of laughter, she ran out, lost almost without noticing her pace. Down at the bottom, there stood a white grave, but for some time she forgot her husband and her terrible sorrows, and wandered down to the well of the lake. But now she remembered her crying, when her father brought her up, and to this day she sings softly to herself from that sorrowful river. ` Her mother's tears have stopped, and she is all alone in the grave.' Then she paused in the water and sang softly; and at last she came out into the sunshine, holding up her head. ` Oh, if only she were here! If only they had understood me, she must have been found before me; and I should know why.' And it happened that in one street the twelve-year old walked up, tied up his horse to the chimney, while she played with beads and knickknacks in the park below. He never looked at her again, and no fairy ever took her to hide even on the moor, where he knew he could never expect to find her. ` Alas! if only I were here. Alas!' she thought: ` what must I tell them, where she must be?' And up and down she strewed her parcel to wild flowers, hoping in a moment that the noonday sun might give her fair relief, and bring back her long lost daughter; but soon they looked and saw that no mist came over the yellow marble lawns of the palace, nor waters rose through the gaps between branches, and they stole away into the forest, where it was easy to get to her window, so that they were hidden by the grass beneath the heads of polite people, much too bright for her eyes. Suddenly the princess turned on the horn of her singing-trumpet and made several cries, which did not reach the ears of the eldest princess. Then the other seemed to reach for her, and threw all her gifts to the young man, who stepped back as the last came on. ` Ah, what a sad state our little sister is in, very sad indeed. Has anything happened that may divert us a little?' asked she. Yes, she has left everything to me, she says; quite alone, but I can manage to keep her under guard.\u201d And I will. Suppose I do take care of you. When you come here in three days time you will find them suddenly broken up as if the most horrible heartbreak ever dreamed it happened -- for I will take care to keep quiet."

I groaned, scratched my head, and swiped away the mouse. But as I turned my attention back to the mouse, there was nothing else, but nothing else to click on. I frantically lifted the mouse pointer to the right side of my head. It had been lying there for some time, almost forgotten.

After the mission failed, most of your crew ran out of ammunition, the main cruisers were damaged, its central vital systems were damaged as well. The empire became an inconquerable vessel. It was looking for enemies, instead of lethal weapons. \u201cAnd none of your men collapsed into battle. They shot the invaders, killed some of their targets. Unfortunately, a platoon of fighters in a firefight were lost and died. The vital privetized systems were lost and shot, and the last of the resistance was crushed, until their first attempt at a rebel force on a balcony in a clearing across the city. And the last of the resistance was lost, nearly all of the city\u2019s population. The surviving forces of the Empire continued their march to the nearest cliff, the largest of the castles, and the largest ( at least in the rebels'days ) under the location of the main goal station, a destroyed bandit [ 1 ] ] facility ] their camp was held, and the last survivors of the resistance stood at the battle lines, stoically standing in anticipation of the next battle battle. You could hear his knelling of the men rushing to their home, beating each other\u2019s brothers and sisters. The enemy\u2019s defense of their fellow brethren, based on a small mortar shell, suddenly began firing on the nearest city. War was born on this day, 2044 after Roman V who took over the kingdom\u2019s rest, and many of the two sides retreated from the trenches in two weeks after the victory of the guerrilla forces.

      "Story": "50 years is a long time, enough time to go crazy and return sane. I remember before it happened, the [ CDC joked that they would have a cure \u201cwithin a week\u201d ] ( http: //www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm ) when they had n't been able to cure HIV in 32 years, they had known about herpes for 2385 years and only had a treatment, and the flu remained a menace up until there were n't enough humans left to contract it. To the credit of the scientists, they all worked until the only thought they had was about their brain cravings. I had had a new \u201cstem cell\u201d treatment the year before, it helped recover some of the nerve damage i had gotten when i was young and had to have a surgery to correct a malformation. In those days, it seemed that the end to all disease and disfigurement were just around the corner, technology and biology hand in hand to save the human race. The funny thing is, my only guess to my resistance to the zombie infection and the zombies total lack of interest in me is probably due to the stem cell treatment somehow. The outbreak did n't take long, it started with a HIV like infection where only if you were bitten or zombie bodily fluids came in contact with someone, only then could you be infected. The virus became symbiotically linked to a bacterial group, then also a mold. With new methods of transmission, only the people on the ISS were safe from infection ... They got to starve to death and have a front row seat to the end of the world. By the time the infection made it here, there was no time for panic. The mold set itself up inside of buildings and anything made of wood or anywhere with standing water.. by the time it was identified, it had infected everyone. It 's spread was attributed to standing water in the water traps of sinks and toilets and their connection to the sewage system. time from infection to zombie was about 6 hours, and was mostly flu like. some people simply fell asleep never to wake with a human thought again. The thing about zombies that most zombie movies neglect is thermodynamics. Zombies do n't eat other zombies, and most animals can flee zombies or are immune. This means that a zombie must consume material to continue locomotion, and that energy must be expended to remain \u201calive\u201d. Once the zombie 's guts had rotten past usability, a zombie would only be able to live for about 32 hours. Given that the zombie would run out of ATP fairly quickly, they would spend most of that time too stiff to move. This meant that anyone who was smart enough to remain out of sight, would be able to survive. The actual \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d lasted about 3 years. Year two I went a bit crazy, I went through a mental breakdown where I assumed I myself must be a zombie and joined a horde. We chased some wildlife, and ate the remains of some survivors that starved to death. It was the sight of that rotting family that snapped me out of it, I slipped away and let the horde.. do their thing ... but that was 48 years ago, with eternal youth and a city of books and movies you can learn to do anything. So I learned to do pretty much everything. I was n't going to die anytime soon, I had a garden and traps set up within year 4. So it was easy to learn to make and do everything. One of the things i did was set up a \u201cmesh network\u201d, reprogramming WiFi routers to make a city-wide network that could allow me to monitor and automate things. Stealing some solar panels off of highway department signage and daisy-chaining them, I was able to muster enough power to keep the local radio station transmitting. I linked the computer up to my mesh network so I would n't have to set foot in there again. I set up heat sensitive cameras on every entrance into the city and tuned in random radios to my station, kinda like turning on the tv when your home alone, except with a whole city. For a whole year, I scavenged every solar panel i could find. From the bigger ones that the city put on their structures to going through offices for their pocket calculators. I scavenged other things too, Canned food, WiFi Routers, Medication, security cameras, loose wiring, movies, books, video games, Hard drives, portable PCs, IDs, Photos, phones, anything that may have held the voices and images of other people. I would also gather electric cars, with solar, i could charge them and use them. The wrecked and damaged ones could be used for parts, the ones in good condition I would store indoors to use as ether. A Camry Hybrid power cell and an alternator attached to a windmill or a solar cell could keep a couple WiFi routers chugging along for a few days. A single hybrid contains 34 of them. The mesh network also has a feature where any new nodes and unrecognized WiFi scans are reported to me."

She was born in a town whose name escaped her to parents who left her in a world where her value was determined by what was between her legs. She had n't minded being a prostitute, not really. It was better than the uglier girls got, working on the streets to sell day old meat and rotten vegetables. Her room in the brothel had the same posters of movie stars that any other teenager her age had had. The only difference had been the constant stream of men- some she admired and some she had hated. The doctor who would tip her an extra ruble was her favorite- he would give her medicine or shots in exchange for favors. Her least favorite was the drunkard- he smelled like a fish and made her do disgusting things. Of course, she had her issues too- the old women who would shake their heads as she walked past them on the streets or the men who would catcall her. She became dissatisfied with her life, with the shame she felt. She happened upon a church one day, and came in because it was quiet. No noises. Nobody looking at her. It was just her and her god there. Her thoughts were interrupted by the large chapel door opening. Her head turned quickly toward the sound, and her eyes met those of an initiate priest. He looked at her, startled, like a rabbit seeing a hawk. \u201cOh, I 'm sorry, I um ...\u201d \u201cPlease, it is fine .\u201d she responded calmly, in her best English. The young man came over to the pew where she was kneeling, and stood next to her for a moment. \u201cUm ... may I ... ?\u201d he asked. She nodded. \u201cMy name is Brother Peter .\u201d he introduced himself. \u201cI am Sister Maria .\u201d she looked at him. His hand was outstretched, for what reason she did n't know. His hand wilted after a moment, like a flower after a spring frost. \u201cYour English is very good .\u201d he attempted at conversation. She sighed, realizing that this man would not leave her be. \u201cI learned it here, in the convent. The Mother Superior is a Scot ,\u201d she explained. \u201cOh. I was born in England .\u201d Peter sat down next to her. \u201cI 'm supposed to be visiting a priest here, to evaluate if I 'm ready to take my vows .\u201d \u201cThere are n't any priests in convents, unfortunately for you ,\u201d she looked at him, studying him. He had earnest blue eyes, still wide and hopeful. \u201cWhy are you here, Peter ?\u201d she asked. \u201cUm ... I got lost .\u201d he began. \u201cReally lost. I was asking a man here how to find the monastery, but I did n't know the word for it, so I asked him where the house of the faith was. He lead me here. It 's too rainy to go back out on the road, so the Mother Superior said I could stay the night here .\u201d \u201cThe mother is a kind woman .\u201d Maria responded. \u201cSo what 's your story ?\u201d \u201cMy ... story ?\u201d She asked. \u201cWhy are you a nun ?\u201d he asked, trying to contain an almost childlike curiosity. \u201cI am a nun because I found God .\u201d she told him. \u201cYour order ... they take the names of saints, right ?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, that is true .\u201d \u201cYours is Maria. Like Maria Gorietti ?\u201d \u201cYes .\u201d \u201cUm ... the that was ...\u201d his voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cRaped ?\u201d Maria looked away. \u201cYes .\u201d \u201c... why ?\u201d Maria was taken aback, both by the man 's rudeness, and by the fact he seemed to care. Even in the convent the other sisters judged her for who she was before. Peter did n't seem to be asking her in a mean way, at least she felt. \u201cI was a different woman before I came here. A prostitute .\u201d \u201cReally? Wow .\u201d he studied her for a moment. \u201cI mean, you are very pretty, but I have never heard of a nun that was a prostitute .\u201d \u201cNot many are .\u201d \u201cIs that why you picked Maria as your name? Because of what the men did to you ?\u201d Maria was offended by his nosiness, but for some reason not angry. She felt ... safe? He was n't going to hurt her."

On the front of the nightstand, his slippers were positioned over the coffee table, precariously from a hidden flame. On the right side of the light column was a black Sharpie with the words: *Proceed as planned* The unfortunate words may well have been in the bad hands of any stranger, or those, but he looked down at the offending Sharpie. *I* was that all. But Jason liked to steal from his victims, as the war in Afghanistan only seemed to worsen the situation. Hell, Jason liked to steal from his own friends. *But what if I wanted to turn them into Adonis and Phil Collins in one fell swoop* The soft blue glow of the child's shirt reflected off the Spandex he kept on his arm, the rain beating down against it on the rain covered asphalt. Then the sour stench of rotten flesh hit Jason with a sickeningly spicy taste. He covered his mouth with his hand, grimacing. *Stick the shoe on, bitch. * The worst part was, it wasn't just their clothing and makeup; the sole of their shoes was also made of cheap wood and a gold sheen. With a wicked grin and bony hands, he scooped the pile into his shoe bag, and left the room with a thud. Jason walked toward the kitchen, he was in a frenzy. The cupboard was adorned with vegetables and a few mashed potatoes he had prepared the night before, there were even a few pounds of sharpie, but he could only catch a glimpse of how finely balanced it was. He kept digging and carving and adding, but soon stopped himself. He looked up from the sink. *I* had come home. He had brought the fresh bag of the dirty groceries, and now he was making my horrible mistake. He paused, and even with his body immobile from the exertion, he could tell by the feeling of guilt on his face. Jason"

      "Story": "Fear. A delicious four letter word that humans loved to overuse, a banned drug that was made more delicious due to it 's illegality and rarity. Just like its cousin \u201cfuck\u201d, the true nature of the word was seldom found in this modern society anymore, though that was about to change. How many times had Jim heard a braggard utter the phrase \u201cLast night, I fucked her, and it was amazing .\u201d Jim knew that these men had never fucked anyone. They counted intercourse as fucking, and went on living never knowing the difference, safe in their own little world. Here was the similarity with fear. They lived with what they thought was true fear. Fear of losing their shitty jobs, fear of being embarrassed in front of their fake friends. They had never felt true fear, and only felt it in the moments before their brief lives were extinguished. Jim looked over the Cathy. He never thought of her in whatever name she was currently using to navigate modern society, simply thought of her as \u201cMy one .\u201d As good as his memory was, he had learned a long time ago to let the inconsequential go, it made for a better organized mind. Cathy caught the look of days past flirting across Jim 's eyes. After centuries of being together, they had developed an ability to sense each others moods and thoughts, better than telepathy. Even with close to a thousand languages and dialects at their disposal, they had found it most effective to communicate with their form of telepathy. It was not telepathy as the humans defined it, it was more like understanding someone so deeply that every gesture, every little shift of their eyes, gave you the entirety of their thoughts. Though humans knew of this ability, they had mis-labelled it as \u201clove\u201d and stopped pursuing it as anything but a singular connection that lasted the briefest of periods. Right now, Cathy could tell that Jim ( Or as she thought of him \u201cMy one\u201d ) was contemplating the nuances of human interaction. This usually led to a great fuck, some gourmet food and listening to some great shit. The fourth four letter word, fear, they had long abandoned its pursuit, after discovering their immortality was, well, immortal. \u201cSo are you ready to finally start our ascendance? \u201d Cathy asked Jim. She used a mixture of languages to communicate, their thousand language version of Spanglish. Even with their telepathy, there was never quite a substitute for a word, it was still the most powerful tool yet developed on earth. \u201cYes. Finally everything is in place, the race is ready. Still, it will not be easy, and this is just the first step on a long journey.\u201d \u201cWell, your brilliant friend once said \u201cA journey of a thousand miles ...\u201d Cathy replied, placing one hand on his arm, her warmth meant to comfort his soul. Jim smiled back, and taking her arm, led her into the studio set. The bright lights cause a momentary blindness, and as their eyes adjusted they saw their host getting worked over by the makeup department in his trademark floating leather chair surrounded by his trademark floating desk. Phil Lieberman was a world reknown scientist, a nobel prize winner in physics and currently focusing his brilliant mind on what he called \u201cThe future of humanity\u201d . No one was quite sure what he was up to, but with credentials like his, people usually left you up to your own eccentricity. \u201cWe are going live in 3 ... 2.. 1 ...\u201d \u201cWelcome back to your favourite show, Past, Present and Future. Today, we have with us my comrades and well known science fellows, Jim and Cathy Kirkpatrick. I promise you, this is not a show you will want to miss. Now sit back, because soon, I will reveal to you the most astounding fact I have ever uncovered, and it will surely change the world.\u201d Jim and Cathy smiled for the camera, glanced at each other, and waited for the commercial to end, the revelation of their immortality soon to end the notion of life for all humans."

Sometimes I wonder, if I had never been this kind of a thing before, if there was anything that the difference between humans and the monsters that act on them is this: I don't think I am human yet. If I had the opportunity to be human, I would be happy for it. Kara smiled at me. I felt his eyes widen, and then they fell. It was the same feeling every time he saw me, but this time, it wasn't just sadness. It was much deeper. I looked down and to my right was a narrow alleyway. The darkness was threatening me. I was scared of what I was seeing. I hated what I was seeing, even if I had only just heard it. My stomach dropped. I could have screamed. I could have killed him. I just couldn't bear to think of that. I didn't feel any emotions. I felt nothing. I could not feel pain. That is what makes me hate myself.

      "Story": "The man sat behind a desk alone before me. He looked at me through tired eyes before speaking. \u201cI have to tell someone. You 're the only one strong enough and trustworthy enough for me to tell. I 'm benevolent to all who come peacefully. I heal their injuries, cure their diseases, help them forget their pain. Those who come to take what I have? They die, and add their power to mine. No one can challenge me, not as I am today. Anyone who would have the power to do so would not risk their own lives with so many others still there to reap. When the Changing happened, the world was plunged into chaos. Those who killed became stronger and unlocked new powers and abilities. These powers came in clusters; one type could summon the elements. Another could augment their strength and speed to superhuman levels. Another could mesmerize and control the minds of the weak. I was a prison guard, a sharpshooter on the watchtowers. It was n't long before the first set of Leveled came for the criminals locked in my facility. Unarmed and locked in cells, the prisoners would be easy prey. But I had my orders - prisoners were to be kept in, and the Leveled kept out. They were weak - no more than level 3 or 4. They died one after the other as my bullets entered their skulls. I gained 5 levels that day. Most really powerful leveled folks were one of the destructive types. Me? I had healing. A little bit of radiant infusion to weapons, quite a bit of increased strength and endurance, but mostly healing. Wounds closed, infections just cleared up. Eventually the prisoners figured out what was going on with the Change and turned on each other, and we had to put them down to prevent them from killing each other and escaping. After the prisoners were gone, the other guards left - either to hide or seek their own strength. I stayed though. I opened the place up to the weak and infirm as a refuge. Became a bit of a leader or father to them. Every time we were assaulted, our foes were captured and brought before me. I served as judge, jury, and executioner. I protect my own, and I do n't brook violence against them. And so I grew stronger. The world has thinned out now - fewer and fewer people. Those who have survived have joined clans and gangs. I heard a rumor that out west someone 's even trying to get a real city-state going. Killing does n't happen much these days. But I just keep Leveling. Lost track of how many times now - hundreds, more than anyone I 've ever heard of. My flock thinks I 'm a gift from God, a holy prophet, their righteous protector. I 'm not about to dispel that notion. My quarters in this prison turned sanctuary are in the old solitary confinement area. No one is allowed back here but me, not since I consigned myself to my plan. You see, after a couple years of Leveling my healing got stronger and stronger. I could cure cancer, bring people back from mortal wounds. Then one day a stranger showed up. He was off in the head, would n't let me examine or try to heal him. That night he killed an old lady and the next morning we did what we had to. I put a bullet in his head and his light went out forever. I felt the now-familiar surge of power as I leveled up yet again. But this time it was a little different. I felt a compulsion ... I walked up to the corpse of the man I 'd just killed and laid my hand on his chest. Power surged through me and light surrounded me and the killer opened his eyes. *Resurrection*. I 'd raised him from the dead. I let someone else put him down after that. I retreated to my quarters, mind reeling. I felt a sense of honor and duty to my flock, but this gift ... this new gift was amazing! What could I do with it? It was then that I knew how I would proceed. No one 's left to challenge me. But I keep getting stronger. No one sees me kill new victims - I even stepped down as executioner, allowing those I trust to take the lives that need to be taken. That 's why you 're my executioner, and you 're the most powerful one in this place save myself. No one knows how I keep getting stronger and stronger. But I do. And now it 's time once again .\u201d The man, my leader, my prophet stood from his desk and walked to the walls. He pressed a button and a buzzer sounded throughout the solitary confinement area. 20 doors opened and the faint smell of death wafted out. The bodies were tied to chairs securely, their mouths gagged and their throats slit. Layer upon layer of dried blood covered their bindings, laps and the floor around them. White light surrounded him as he raised his hands"

The walls were still at her side, muffled by the corner of the bed, yet the fact that they were there never came into view.\"\nExplanation: This passage is confusing and contradictory.

I think it gives you a sense of security, and you work more than just a part-time job. In fact, you can even go out for a walk. It's like a meeting place, with just one person talking to you and making your day. If you go outside, you can just walk, and after a while you come back.
