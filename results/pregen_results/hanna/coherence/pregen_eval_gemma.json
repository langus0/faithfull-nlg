      "Article": "Vitamin and mineral supplements are becoming more and more popular as health conscious shoppers focus on good nutrition, but do we really need pills to optimise our diet? Not according to nutritionist and author sarah flower, who says that cooking with the right ingredients should give you all the goodness you need. ` the cleaner your diet - using fresh ingredients and cooking at home - the less likely you are to need to rely on supplements to boost your health.' She told mailonline. Scroll down for video. It's time to ditch vitamin pills for a diet rich in clean, fresh and unprocessed foods, says sarah flower. ` the typical western diet is heavily processed and sugar ridden,' explains sarah, `this makes us more susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies.' And while it may seem like common sense to eat more unprocessed and raw foods, ms flower believes we are still not doing enough. ` we are living in a society where it is possible to be overweight and deficient in essential nutrients.' She continued.' A diet rich in oily fish, whole grains, lean protein, fruit and vegetables should provide enough nutrients,' she said. Other factors to consider include your ability to absorb the food - digestive complaints can often impede our ability to absorb nutrients. ` pregnancy, ill health and the elderly may need more support,' she said. And menstruating women may benefit from adding oils ( evening primrose oil ) and a multivitamin rich in magnesium to help alleviate pms symptoms ( ms flowers recommends magnesium citrate ). Always opt for steaming over boiling vegetables and eat as many raw pieces as you can every day. ` fruit and vegetables not only contain vitamins but also vital phytonutrients, which have an amazing ability to protect us against degenerative diseases such as cancer, alzheimer's and heart disease,'"

The kennel club says seemingly harmless foods such as hot cross buns and onions can be killers - - and is urging owners to be alert to the threat. Around 56, 000 dogs were treated for poisoning between 2010 and 2014, according to figures compiled by the charity and the veterinary poisons information service. Of those, 470 dogs died. Sick : around 56, 000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014. Unlike crufts prizewinner jagger the irish setter, who died last month after eating meat laced with poison, most poisoned pets will simply have eaten something they found lying around the home or fallen ill after being fed treats by their well - meaning owners. Painkillers were the most common cause of poisoning, followed by rat and mouse bait and chocolate - - which can cause sickness, diarrhoea and fits and trigger heart problems. Dark chocolate is particularly toxic. Foods such as sultanas, grapes and raisins are also highly dangerous for dogs, causing canine kidneys to fail. Dried forms of the fruit found in cakes are the most toxic. Onions, garlic and leeks can cause life - threatening anaemia. Nick sutton, a kennel club poisons expert, said : `there are any number of ways a dog can get access to dangerous and potentially lethal substances, whether by accident, deliberate feeding or through owners mistakenly believing certain products - - particularly foods eaten by humans - - are fine for a dog to eat. ` many seemingly harmless foods can be dangerous for a dog and owners need to be aware of these risks in order to protect their much - loved pets.' The popularity of e - cigarettes has seen them feature more prominently among poisoning cases, with 64 dogs taken to the vet in 2014 after chewing the nicotine - rich refills - - an increase of 300 per cent."

Professor ninian peckitt, 63, claimed he had simply `digitally manipulated' the patient's face as part of hospital treatment, but witnesses said that in reality he had actually been hitting him, the tribunal was told. The world - renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A medical practitioners tribunal service hearing in manchester was told a man referred to as patient a had suffered `extensive injuries' to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to ipswich hospital in february 2012 where professor peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo - facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher hamlet, representing the general medical council, told the hearing : `the case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.' He added that patient a had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told professor peckitt embarked on a `closed reduction' procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr peckitt was working as an honorary locum at ipswich hospital in suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in february 2012.
