      "Article": "Great britain's colin fleming says tennis players guilty of match-fixing should face life bans. Evidence of suspected match-fixing in elite tennis was revealed this week by a bbc and buzzfeed news investigation. \"future players will see the headlines and see it's not an option at all,\" doubles representative fleming told bbc scotland on wednesday. \"i think if anyone is found to be doing it, that should be them. They shouldn't be playing again.\" Fleming, 31, and his partner jonathan erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the australian open on wednesday by robin haase and fernando verdasco. \"the key thing about sport is that it's pure, you don't know the outcome of any given match, and that's what people pay to come and watch,\" he added. \"you never know what's going to happen. That's key  and they have to preserve that. \"i've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; i certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there.\" The scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the tennis integrity unit (tiu), set-up to police the sport. \"your guess is as good as mine,\" he said of those involved. \"there were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the tiu has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty. \"it can just be people throwing money on a match.\" Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in melbourne. \"i think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the aussie open, i've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre,\" he said. \"players going at it and the best player winning on that day. There's no doubt in my mind that is the case here.\""

This omission could lead to confusion about what Grealish is apologizing for.\nSeverity: 3\n\nOverall score: Poor\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains a significant factual inconsistency (Error 1) that completely flips the subject and action described in the article, earning a severity score of 5. Additionally, the lack of context for a crucial element (Error 2) further detracts from the summary's factual consistency.

The identified issue (Error 1) is more about contextual framing than a direct factual inconsistency, which might slightly affect the reader's understanding of Bruce's statement's origin but does not alter the fact itself.

This alteration can lead to misunderstanding of Emy Afalava's birthplace's legal status.\nSeverity: 4\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"Emy afalava has been denied the right to vote because he should be a citizen.\"\nExplanation: The summary inaccurately simplifies the reason for the denial of citizenship. According to the article, Afalava was denied the right to vote because the federal government insists he is not a citizen, despite his belief (and the constitutional implication) that he should be one due to his birth in a U.S. Territory. The summary omits the government's stance, altering the factual dynamic.\nSeverity: 5\n\nError 3:\nLocation: \"How can it be.\"\nExplanation: While this phrase is present in both the article and the summary, in the context of the summary, it lacks the preceding explanatory content that sets up the injustice being questioned.

      "Article": "A court in the philippines has found a us marine guilty of killing a transgender woman. Lance corporal joseph scott pemberton was convicted of killing jennifer laude in a hotel room in olongapo city, north-west of manila, last year. Pemberton will face between six and 12 years imprisonment. The case has strained ties between the us and the philippines, a former us colony where the americans have a significant military presence. The marine was on leave in olongapo on 11 october 2014, after joint military exercises with the philippine army, when he met ms laude in a bar. Police said they left together and checked into a hotel, where she was found dead the next day, apparently strangled and with her head inside the hotel toilet. Pemberton had previously testified in court that he had attacked ms laude after he realised she was transgender, but said she was still alive when he left the room. The prosecution had argued pemberton should be convicted of murder, but the court downgraded this to homicide. Pemberton was also ordered to pay at least 4.5 million pesos ($95,350; \u00e2\u00a363,140) to ms laude's family. Ms laude's sister, malou, told reuters news agency: \"we expected a murder conviction but instead got homicide. We are not content with the decision.\" Pemberton will be temporarily detained in a philippine jail until the philippine and us governments agree on where he should be held during his prison term. The case has led to calls from left-wing groups for the philippines to end its military agreements with the us. Under the agreement, the philippines can prosecute us military personnel but the us retains custody over them \"from the commission of the offence until completion of all judicial proceedings\", the associated press reports."

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder and two weapons charges, setting the stage for his trial in fall river, massachusetts, that began in january. He's accused of orchestrating the shooting death of lloyd. During closing arguments, prosecutor william mccauley called the football player the trigger man. Jury deliberations began tuesday. Even after closing arguments, the motive is still unclear but not legally required to get a conviction. Still, jurors like to know a motive. Evidence collected in lloyd's death led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston. It's scheduled to begin in may, but officials say it will be pushed back. The trial has involved a complicated cast of characters, including two sisters who played important roles in the lives of hernandez and lloyd. Here is a primer :. Inside the case against aaron hernandez. Odin lloyd. Odin lloyd was a 27 - year - old semi - pro football player for the boston bandits. He was found dead on june 17, 2013, less than a mile from hernandez's home in north attleboro, massachusetts. He had been shot six times. Lloyd met hernandez while dating shaneah jenkins, the sister of hernandez's fiancee, shayanna jenkins. Hernandez is charged with orchestrating lloyd's execution. Daniel de abreu and safiro furtado. Daniel de abreu and safiro furtado were killed outside a boston nightclub on july 16, 2012. Earlier that evening, prosecutors say, de abreu accidentally bumped into hernandez, spilling a drink. Later that night, hernandez was driving an suv and allegedly pulled up alongside de abreu and furtado's car near the nightclub and fired a. 38 - caliber revolver"

He now had to take the consequences of his decision, including the fact that an act of treachery has become widely known as \"doing a gove\", he said. The 49-year-old former justice secretary made the comments during an interview with fern britton, to be broadcast on bbc one on sunday. He appeared to suggest he had not given up on a return to front-line politics, saying he hoped to \"make a contribution\" in the future. Mr gove said his decision to back leave in the eu referendum had placed a \"significant strain\" on his relationship with his long-term friend david cameron. He and his wife, daily mail journalist sarah vine, had been close friends with mr cameron and his wife samantha - but the two couples have not had a \"proper conversation\" since the 23 june poll, he said. Mr cameron quit as prime minister after he lost the eu referendum, sparking a leadership campaign which saw mr gove back boris johnson. He then changed his mind and decided to run himself, publicly questioning mr johnson's ability to do the job. Mr gove would not reveal what mr johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support, but he conceded that \"the way in which i declared my stand for the leadership, i shouldn't have done it that way\". \"as i look back on that time, i think that there were mistakes that i made... \"i also think that my initial instinct that i was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well most of my colleagues agreed.\" After mrs may entered downing street, mr johnson entered the cabinet as foreign secretary, while mr gove remains on the conservative backbenches. \"when theresa may became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if i'd been in her shoes i would have sacked me too,\" said mr gove. \"so i entirely accept that sacking me at the time was the right thing to do. \"i had six years when i was a government minister. I had a chance to make a difference - i hope that i did.\" But he conceded that \"nothing is forever in politics\". \"i have to accept that the way in which i spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes and having made mistakes you have to take the consequences.\" Mr gove said he is now focusing on his work on the commons committee on exiting the eu and wanted to campaign for children at risk of abuse or neglect.

Nye frankie newman, 17, from aldershot in hampshire, died in the french capital on new year's day. Speaking at the memorial in guildford, his mother debs malone told the crowd of teenagers to carry his spirit \"forever\". A minute's silence was held at the event, organised by the brewman parkour group mr newman co-founded. His friends took part in a \"remembrance jam\" afterwards. Ms malone, 49, said: \"can i ask you all, please carry nye's spirit with you forever and always, and smile. \"i want you all to put your hand on your heart now and we are going to get down for my boy. \"stay safe, stay brave, stay strong yeah? And be happy.\" Alex grubb, 18, who helped to organise the event, described the teenager as kind, caring and \"very eccentric\". He said: \"he had his own style, he wasn't like anyone else. He was a bit out there, very opinionated but very loving at the same time.\" Organisers estimated about 200 people attended the memorial. Before the event, guildford council and surrey police had warned businesses to take \"reasonable measures to prevent rooftop access\". But organiser luke stones, 16, said: \"we have had made it clear people should not go on rooftops. \"if they go on rooftops, it's not parkour, that's another sport. Today, we are sticking to ground level.\" He said rooftop running was more usually referred to as urbex, climbing or roof-topping. Mr stones said people had travelled from across europe and hong kong, where mr newman visited in the summer. He said organisers could not comment on mr newman's death, but confirmed he \"was not participating in parkour\" at the time of the accident. Guildford council said it provided portsmouth road car park as a meeting place for the memorial, but not as a place for free-running. A statement said: \"by providing an area for the memorial event, the council does not condone or encourage parkour or free-running in our car parks, properties or anywhere else in the town or borough, whether it is at a low level or on rooftops.\" Mr stones defended the activity and said: \"it is another form of exercise. \"it is a way to express your emotions through movement. \"when you're doing parkour you're at one with yourself, it's almost like a meditation.\" The uk this year became the first country to officially recognise parkour as a sport."

Judge carlos castro martins reversed the order he had issued in september, which had barred any work on the belo monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the xingu river. He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing. The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists. Judge martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing. He had barred the norte energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the xingu river, including building a port, using explosives, installing dikes and building canals. Legal wrangling. Norte energia appealed against the decision and judge martins ruled on friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work. \"since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing,\" he said. Judge martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project \"could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen\". He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by brazil's indian affairs department (funai) and the national environment agency, ibama. Norte energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban. If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the three gorges in china and itaipu, which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay.

The number of gps from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the nhs tries to combat a shortage of staff. Foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two - thirds. Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the nhs is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the health and social care information centre show that 22. 0 per cent of current gps gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19. 8 per cent in 2004. But the figure is 71 per cent in barking and dagenham, east london, 63 per cent in medway, kent, and 58 per cent in north lincolnshire. The nhs is facing a shortage because many gps are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The royal college of gps estimates that the nhs will need to hire at least 8, 000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The nhs employs 40, 584 gps, of whom 8, 941 are from overseas. This is up from 6, 921 in 2004 when there were 34, 855 family doctors in total. Dr richard vautrey, deputy chairman of the british medical association's gp committee, said : `we need gps from around the world to support the health service, and we simply don't train enough. ` we need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice, and to expose them more to general practice, so they see it more as an attractive option for the future.' The figures do not state where the foreign gps trained but separate data from the general medical council shows many are from india, pakistan, south africa and nigeria.

      "Summary": "The six-strong gang dressed in high-vis jackets were captured on cctv working throughout thursday night. The footage reveals they returned again on saturday - spending another eight hours cleaning out the jewels and cash left there for safekeeping. They used wheelie bins to remove pounds worth of jewellery and valuables from the safe."

    "result": "```\nError 1:\nLocation: \"throughout thursday night\"\nExplanation: The article states that the gang was captured on CCTV working throughout Thursday night, but also mentions they broke in just after 9:23 pm (implying a specific time frame rather than the entire night). However, this is not a severe error since it doesn't fundamentally alter the fact. A more significant inconsistency is that the summary omits mentioning the initial break-in time and focuses solely on Thursday and Saturday, potentially misleading readers about the full scope of the robbery's timing.\nSeverity: 2\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"They used wheelie bins to remove pounds worth of jewellery and valuables from the safe.\"\nExplanation: The article specifies \"millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables\" were removed using wheelie bins, but the summary truncates this to just \"pounds,\" which significantly underrepresents the value mentioned in the article.\nSeverity: 4\n\nOverall score: Fair\nExplanation of the score: While the summary captures some key elements of the robbery (e.g., the gang's return on Saturday, use of wheelie bins), it contains errors that affect its factual consistency. Omitting details and misrepresenting the value of stolen goods are notable inconsistencies. However, since these do not completely distort the core events as described in the article, the summary is not deemed 'Unacceptable' or 'Poor'. Instead, it falls into the 'Fair' category, indicating room for improvement to achieve higher factual consistency.\n```"

Prices have fallen by the largest amount in almost a decade as supermarkets continue to slash the cost of milk, vegetables and meat as they compete with each other and with emerging budget chains for customers. And on the high street clothes and footwear have become even more affordable - with prices dropping by around 7. 8 per cent in the last 12 months - as the low cost of oil makes transporting and selling goods even cheaper. Consumers are taking to the shops as they cash in on the falling prices of supermarket staples and clothes. Milk, bread, eggs, cheese and roasting chickens have seen the biggest fall in price at the supermarket checkout as the large chains have been forced to reduce their prices to compete with the rise of budget stores aldi and lidl. According to the british retail consortium - nielsen price index, goods in shops cost 2. 1 per cent lower this march than the same time last year, the guardian reported.

Some 563 were held or arrested by port of dover police officers last year - up from 148 in 2013, a bbc radio kent freedom of information request shows. The figures come days after dozens of migrants attempted to storm the channel tunnel's calais terminal. The home office said it was providing funding to bolster security and that many crossing attempts had been foiled. The foi shows 46 illegal immigrants were detained or arrested at dover - one of the main gateways to britain - between january and april this year. The number of detentions and arrests is also up significantly from 2012, when 105 were held or arrested. Around 3,000 migrants from countries including eritrea, syria and afghanistan are camped at a site dubbed \"the jungle ii\" near the port of calais. French aid workers have reported a \"catastrophic\" situation there. Road haulage association chief executive richard burnett, who recently visited calais, said migrants are going to great lengths to cross the channel. He told radio kent: \"they think it's a great place to be and (britain's) their target. They will do anything they possibly can to get into the uk.\" Last week, channel tunnel services were delayed and cancelled after immigrants entered restricted areas on the french side. And last month hundreds of migrants tried to board uk-bound lorries amid chaos as a strike forced the suspension of services through the tunnel. Eurotunnel said at the time that the number of migrants in the calais area was the \"highest ever\". Hauliers have been advised by the freight transport association not to stop within about 60 miles (97km) of calais, to stick with other drivers and make sure padlocks are always kept on vehicles. Responding to the latest figures, a home office spokesman said 40,000 attempted illegal crossings of the channel had been foiled last year. He added: \"we are providing funding to bolster the security of ports in northern france and belgium, including a \u00e2\u00a32m upgrade of detection technology, a \u00e2\u00a31m extension of dog searching capacity and \u00e2\u00a312m to reinforce security at calais and other ports. \"during the current period of disruption to cross-channel services, border force has put its contingency plans into operation to ensure security is maintained. \"we have deployed additional border force staff and sniffer dogs in northern france as well as bolstering screening checks at dover for both tourist and freight vehicles.\" The port of dover police is a non-home office constabulary funded entirely by the port authority, dover harbour board.

Lady soames wanted coast scene near cannes (1935) to stay in the commons and view from a bathing hut at the miami surf club, 1946 at the war rooms off whitehall in central london. The paintings have been accepted in lieu of inheritance tax. Churchill produced more than 500 artworks, many of them at chartwell, and continued his hobby well into his 80s. Lady soames previously wrote that \"painting literally grabbed\" her father in 1915, when he was 41, \"thereafter playing an increasing and abiding role in his life, renewing the source of his great inner strength and enabling him to face storms, ride out depressions and rise above the tough passages in his political life\". The 50th anniversary of the world war two leader's death in 1965 was commemorated in january. As well as 37 of churchill's works, the collection accepted for the nation also includes a painting by sir john lavery of the politician standing at his easel and the aly khan gold cup, which was won by churchill's horse, high hat.

The review into 22 abuse cases in northern ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system. The police service of northern ireland (psni) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In september 2013, the psni said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in northern ireland. Officers said they had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The psni investigation was known was operation owl. Thursday's report, examining the psni response, has been published by the safeguarding board for northern ireland. It said psni officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system. However, it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - \"limited and inconsistent\". While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, stormont's health minister simon hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. He said the review had identified \"a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the psni's public protection branch, det ch supt george clarke said that following operation owl, the psni has \"implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe\". \"indeed, in april of this year, the psni formed the public protection branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. \"the new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the psni has also revised its missing persons protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. \"this protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the psni and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" mr clarke added. Last year, a separate review into the issue concluded that sexual exploitation was a growing threat to young people in northern ireland. That report also said that some abusers were thought to have links to paramilitary groups."

The oil painting - which measures nine inches by seven - of a catholic saint was believed to be the work of a `follower' of 16th century renaissance master el greco.

Auctioneer richard bromell ( pictured ) gave the tiny painting an estimated value of about $ 300 to $ 400 but it ended up selling for more than $ 120, 000. It was acquired by the owner's late father in the 1970s for very little. He bought it because he believed it was a depiction of saint peter, who shares his name. And it was inherited by his son, who has not been named, who kept it in his loft for the past eight years before deciding to sell it following a clear - out.

      "Article": "The oil price has fallen to a new seven-year low after the international energy agency (iea) forecast a slowdown in growth in demand for oil. The price of brent crude oil fell below $39 a barrel at one point, its lowest since december 2008. The iea said demand in the current quarter was growing by 1.3 million barrels a day, down from 2.2 million barrels in the previous quarter. The iea predicts that will slip back to 1.2 million barrels a day next year. The price of brent crude fell to $38.90 a barrel at one point, before recovering slightly to $39.13 - still down 60 cents in the trading session. Us crude oil also fell, down 50 cents to $36.12 a barrel. Oil prices are down more than 10% over the week. The trigger was a meeting of oil producers' cartel opec late last week, which broke up in disarray as the member countries failed to agree to put a lid on production. Opec producers pumped more oil in november than in any month since late 2008, almost 32 million barrels per day. That comes at a time when the world's economic growth is slowing, blunting demand for raw materials. The iea said that although consumption was likely to have peaked in the third quarter, demand growth of 1.2 million barrels a day was still healthy. Earlier this week, the us energy information administration forecast that us shale oil production, now a major source of oil supply, would fall in january for the ninth month in a row. Sustained falls in output could help to stabilise the price of oil, although some market forecasters suggest the price could continue to fall to as low as $20 a barrel."

      "Article": "Decriminalising tv licence fee evasion could close bbc channels, the corporation's strategy director has warned. James purnell said it would increase non-payment and cost the bbc \u00a3200m. The sum is the equivalent of bbc four, cbbc and cbeebies, which would have to be taken off air, mr purnell said at an event to  relaunch the iplayer service. Culture secretary maria miller said the move should be discussed during talks to renew the bbc's charter before 2017. Mr purnell, who previously held the post in the labour government, said \"it would be a huge risk to do it now\". \"the choice would be: either we take those services off or the government would have to have a higher licence fee,\" he said in reference to bbc four - the arts and culture channel - and the bbc's children's stations. He argued decriminalisation would inevitably lead to greater non-payment of the tv licence, which would force an increase in the fee. It is currently \u00a3145.50 and has been frozen at that annual amount since 2010. It is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device. In 2012 about 155,000 people were convicted and fined for not paying the licence fee, while there were some 180,000 prosecutions. Mr purnell added downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor. \"either you have a low penalty - in which case the evasion rates would go up and everyone would have to pay a higher licence fee - or a penalty which is higher and more difficult to pay,\" he said. The bbc has previously said \"legislation is a matter for the government\". \"just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around \u00a335m, the equivalent of around 10 bbc local radio stations,\" it added. The government has floated the idea to ease pressure on the courts system. But it will not be discussed before charter renewal talks - which determine how the bbc is funded what it does and how it is managed. The current bbc charter runs out in 2016. Meanwhile, labour mp john mcdonnell has tabled an early day motion in parliament calling on the bbc to reverse its decision to close bbc three as a television channel. The motion stated bbc three has been the home of programmes including gavin and stacey, and raised fears changes could lead to compulsory redundancies. It added the bbc should receive a licence fee increase that tracks inflation when the corporation's charter is renewed next year."

Recent planning rows have left the future of the stadium in question.

The win is the third time in four years that skt has taken the title. It also won the title in 2015. The final ran for six hours and was held in front of almost 20,000 lol fans at the staples center in los angeles. Skt's lee sang-hyeok, aka faker, was named as the most valuable player of the tournament. The total prize pot for the tournament was $5m with $750,000 going to second place team samsung. The money available to teams taking part was increased by fan contributions. Writing on the rock, paper shotgun gaming news site, philippa warr said the final had been \"breathtaking\", as the samsung team had fought back from losing the first two games. However, she said, everything had changed in the \"beautiful\" third game, which lasted 70 minutes and saw samsung wrest a keenly contested win from skt. Samsung then took the fourth game more easily to set up the decider. In the event, warr said, skt's \"fluidity\" and experience had won through, giving them the title, cash and summoner's cup trophy. League of legends is a massively popular game involving two teams of five players fighting over a small map. Each player controls a hero outfitted with a variety of attacks or defence abilities, and the winner is the first to destroy their opponent's base.

China dismissed the reports as \"hype\", but said it had the right under international law to defend itself. Several nations claim territory in the resource-rich south china sea, which is also an important shipping route. A spokesman for mr kerry said satellite images appeared to confirm china had deployed anti-aircraft missiles on woody or yongxing island in the paracels. The island is claimed by china, taiwan and vietnam and the presence of missiles would significantly increase tensions. Mr kerry said the us expected to have a \"very serious conversation\" with china over its presence. \"there is every evidence, every day, that there has been an increase of militarisation from one kind or another. It's a serious concern,\" he said. The latest images of woody island were captured by imagesat international. A picture dated 3 february shows a beach on the island empty. By 14 february it contains several missile launchers and support vehicles. But the chinese foreign minister, wang yi, said reports were a western media invention. He defended \"the limited and necessary self-defence facilities\" on islands inhabited by chinese personnel as \"consistent with the right for self-preservation and self-protection.... under the international law\". China has been carrying out extensive land reclamation work in the region, which it says is legal and for civilian purposes. But the work has angered other countries which also claim the territory, and there is growing concern about the implications of the area becoming militarised. The south china sea dispute has been a topic of debate at a meeting of south east asian regional leaders in california. Us president barack obama said the members had discussed the need for \"tangible steps\" to reduce tensions. Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the south china sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years. Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by taiwan, china, vietnam, the philippines, malaysia and brunei. China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols, while the us says it opposes restrictions on freedom of navigation and unlawful sovereignty claims - by all sides, but seen by many as aimed at china.

An earlier coroner's report said his body had \"signs of wounds\" but no broken bones, according to the semi-official news agency mehr. Mr beheshti's death sparked an international outcry. Last week, three people were reported to have been arrested and subsequently, according to an opposition website, released. According to opposition website, kalameh, the suspects had been involved in mr beheshti's interrogation. Mr beheshti's mother has been forbidden to speak to the press. But an opposition website quoted her as saying she had been offered \"blood money\" in compensation. She added: \"i said i didn't want any. What i want is for the world to know that they killed my son. They killed sattar.\" It is thought mr beheshti was targeted for his writings on political and social issues on his blog and on facebook. The blogger spent one night in tehran's notorious evin prison on 30 october, where he wrote an official complaint to prison authorities alleging ill-treatment, before being moved to an unknown location. His death provoked criticism from politicians and human rights groups, amnesty international said mr beheshti had complained of being threatened the day before his arrest."

    "result": "```\nError 1:\nLocation: \"A coroner's report into the death of iranian blogger sattar beheshti has concluded that he died of shock.\"\nExplanation: The article actually states that it was the Tehran prosecutor's office that mentioned \"shock\" as the most likely cause of death, not a coroner's report conclusion. A coroner's report is mentioned in the article, but it only noted \"signs of wounds\" with no broken bones, without specifying the cause of death.\nSeverity: 4\n\nError 2:\nLocation: (entire summary)\nExplanation: The summary omits crucial context and details from the article, such as the circumstances of Mr. Beheshti's arrest, allegations of torture, and the international outcry following his death. While not strictly factual inconsistencies, these omissions significantly impact the summary's ability to accurately represent the article's content. However, since the task focuses solely on factual consistency (presence of unsupported facts), this point highlights a broader issue but doesn't fit the defined error criteria for factual inconsistency as per the instructions.\nSeverity: N/A (as per the strict definition provided)\n\nOverall score: Fair\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains one notable error regarding the source of the conclusion about the cause of death, which affects its factual consistency. However, it does not introduce entirely new, unsupported facts beyond this misattribution.

Michael barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on interstate 30 just northeast of dallas, and uploaded it to cnn ireport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. ` `it was shocking,'' he said. ` `i didn't know what i was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt.' ' barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary scott, co - lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. ` `thanking god for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,'' she wrote. The tour manager told cnn affiliate ktvt that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her bible. The band's two other members, charles kelley and dave haywood, were not traveling on the bus, ktvt reported.

Boston has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby, wcvb - tv said. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line tuesday morning, and also by fans online.

The grocer magazine reported that the firm is charging \u00a32.64 for a 250g jar. It is the first supermarket to raise the price of marmite since the recent dispute between tesco and manufacturer unilever over the effect of the falling pound on production costs. A morrisons spokesman said: \"sometimes we have to increase prices as a result of costs rising.\" Unilever has raised the wholesale price of many household products, including pg tips tea and pot noodles, because falls in the value of sterling have increased the cost of products made outside the uk. The pound has lost nearly a fifth of its value since the uk voted to leave the eu in a referendum in june. It is the world's worst-performing currency on the global money markets this year. This makes imported goods more expensive because they continue to cost the same in dollars or euros, but the price is higher when converted into sterling. Morrisons said it did its best to avoid putting prices up. It added: \"more often than not we have been reducing prices and more than 3,000 products are currently cheaper in our supermarkets than they were last year.\" Tesco's row with unilever broke out earlier this month and has since been resolved, according to both sides.

A \"terrorist hide\" was uncovered at capanagh forest near larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, home secretary theresa may said mi5 believed an attack on targets in great britain by dissident republicans had become \"a strong possibility\". Analysis: vincent kearney, bbc news ni's home affairs correspondent. The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det supt kevin geddes said the threat level in northern ireland from dissident republican groups remains \"severe\" and an attack is \"highly likely\". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a \"substantial number of explosive devices\". Det supt geddes said the seizure was significant \"both in terms of its size and its capability\". \"a number of these devices were ready to be deployed,\" he added. \"this seizure has undoubtedly saved lives.\" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In march, an arms find was made at carnfunnock country park near larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. \"there are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,\" det supt geddes said.

But gunter is mindful of previous failures and says wales will be aiming to seal their place in france with a positive result against bosnia on saturday. \"the near misses are there as a reminder that in football even the most unlikely thing can happen until the job is done,\" he added. \"we've worked so hard for so long, it'd be a massive mistake to get complacent and think the job is done. \"if we start thinking we'll be celebrating on saturday night we'll be caught out. It's a really tough game. We have done well because we've always prepared in the right way. \"until we've qualified we have to concentrate as anything can happen.\" Gareth bale has been integral to wales' recent success, scoring six of their nine goals in this campaign, and a calf injury had made the real madrid forward a doubt for the forthcoming double-header. But he returned for his club side against atletico madrid on sunday and is expected to feature against bosnia and andorra. \"gareth is here, he's fit, he's done the same as everybody else. It's brilliant news for us and the gaffer [chris coleman] as well,\" said gunter. \"i don't think if he's fit and here we'll look beyond the game at the weekend. It'd be a brave man to tell him he's not playing saturday! \"if he's fit i'm sure he'll be involved and hopefully in the same form as the rest of the campaign.\""

Heidi bretscher's troubles began around mile 17 of the rock n' roll raleigh marathon that took place earlier this month. The 28 - year - old runner was so far ahead of the pack it wasn't clear to her which way she was meant to go. Wrong way : heidi bretscher, 28, said she was on pace to beat her personal record when she, and the two cyclists who were accompanying her, missed an unmarked turn. Retracing her steps : at mile 19, bretscher was leading the women's race by about 30 minutes. She found a police officer who gave her a ride back to mile 17. Somehow, she ended up running entirely off the planned route and around a lake that wasn't even on the course. Despite her unscheduled detour, ms. Bretscher's was brought back on track by a couple of helpful cops who drove her in their patrol cars back to the point in the race where things became muddled. After working out her timings and distances she still managed to cross the line well ahead of her closest rival. ` i'm a little frustrated,' she told abc 11 following her victory.' I ran three miles off course because i didn't know which way to run in the race.' ` usually when you cross the finish line, you're really excited. I wasn't excited,' she said.'

It is the latest in a series of angry gestures by pyongyang. The south's president park geun-hye has ordered the army to be on alert.

Speaking during a parliamentary debate, philip hollobone said individual fireworks are extremely dangerous. But business minister jo johnson dismissed a ban and insisted current laws work well. The debate came after a petition to restrict the use of fireworks attracted more than 100,000 names. The petition, which called for restrictions on when fireworks can be used, was started by jill cutsforth, from beverley, east yorkshire, and julie doorne, from sleaford, lincolnshire in a bid to reduce stress and fear in people and animals. But, mr hollobone, mp for kettering, called for the government to go further. He said: \"i think there's great merit in saying all fireworks displays need to be licensed with a licensed operator, and frankly, amateur family-organised fireworks displays in people's back gardens are basically rubbish.\" Labour's angela smith, a member of the the environment, food and rural affairs committee, also backed the petition, arguing that restricting the number of days the public and organised events can set off fireworks should be restricted. She said: \"ideally, we would end the use of fireworks in back gardens. But i do understand the difficulty in delivering that as policy.\" Instead, she called for tighter regulations to govern how people use fireworks. Mr johnson acknowledged the concerns raised but said restricting their use to traditional holidays would be ineffective. \"it is likely that those who already use fireworks in an anti-social or inconsiderate way would not be deterred by further regulation,\" he said. He added: \"restrictions in use could lead to a drop in legitimate sales, leading to job losses not only in the firework industry but independent and associated businesses.\" Bracknell mp phillip lee also warned the debate that restricting the number of days that displays are permitted could reduce the viability of well-performing fireworks businesses.

The average \"worst case\" is between two weeks and five months, with the longest delay of 18 months recorded in 2014/15. Cosla, the umbrella body for local councils, declined to comment. Age scotland's research, compiled using freedom of information requests, found significant variations across councils in the time taken to carry out assessments. Under national guidelines, people should wait no longer than six weeks for care services to be provided after an assessment has taken place. Age scotland found that about 10% of people were not provided with services within the six-week limit over the past three years. The charity said its research suggested that about 3,000 elderly people each year wait longer than six weeks for services to be put in place. Most councils do not record the reasons why delays occur, but many cited instances where delays were caused by the person being admitted to hospital or waiting for a place in their chosen care home. Staff shortages, financial constraints and delays in adapting homes were also cited. Age scotland received freedom of information responses from 25 out of 32 councils. Chief executive keith robson said: \"these are deeply concerning figures showing thousands of older people facing delays in the care provision they need being put in place. \"it also means payments for free personal care they are entitled to are not being received. \"this confirms the experiences of a number of older people and their families who have been in touch with age scotland's helpline to tell us their experiences of delays in the system. \"as we look to local authority elections next month, age scotland has contacted council candidates across scotland to ask them to ensure providing high-quality health and social care services is made an urgent priority by new administrations.\""

And they were doing that all day, every day.' ' doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $ 5, 000 she had earned babysitting. In 2006, she purchased land in surkhet, a district in western nepal. She worked for two years with the local community to build the kopila valley children's home. Today, kopila - - which means `` flower bud'' in nepali - - is home to about 50 children, from infants to teenagers. Doyne started the blinknow foundation to support and grow her efforts. In 2010, the group opened its kopila valley school, which today educates more than 350 students. Doyne lives in nepal year - round, traveling to the u. S. A few times a year. See more cnn heroes.

      "Article": "Mlas have voted against dup calls for a significant reduction in the \u00a390 mandatory parking fine during a debate in the northern ireland assembly. They also rejected a plan to introduce free parking for the first 30 minutes. The changes were proposed by four dup mlas, but infrastructure minister chris hazzard said their motion was based on \"seriously misguided logic\". He added that enforcing the 30-minute free parking system would be \"extremely resource intensive\". However, the assembly did pass a sinn f\u00e9in amendment calling for a review of on-street parking arrangements which mr hazzard said he was \"minded\" to implement. \"i'm certainly not opposed to a review of sorts - a strategic review of on-street car parking policy and the direction of travel,\" the minister told bbc news ni. \"what i was opposed to, with the dup motion, was their pre-determined outcome of any such review, that we would set in stone before we began a massive reduction in penalty fines, i don't think that would be appropriate.\" The rejected dup motion was signed by ex-minister edwin  poots, and his party colleagues william humphrey, george robinson and alex easton. They said \"greater flexibility\" was needed in parking policy to encourage more trade in town and villages. Parking enforcement in northern ireland was privatised in 2006. Initially, fines were levied at \u00a360, with the option of a 50% reduction if the bill was paid within a fortnight. However, in 2012, stormont mlas voted for the penalty to be increased to its current level of \u00a390 - or \u00a345 if it is settled within 14 days. The then roads minister danny kennedy said at the time that bigger fines would \"act as a greater deterrent to those who choose not to park properly\". The current minister said \"at least two thirds\" of people who receive parking tickets pay within two weeks, and therefore pay at the lower rate of \u00a345. \"i think, when we look across many states, this is an appropriate amount, \"mr hazzard added. Last month, a belfast city council committee voted to end the council's annual policy of offering free car parking in the city centre in the run-up to christmas."

Koeman has advised midfielder james mccarthy not to join the ireland squad after previously saying he had been \"massively overloaded\" by the republic. Republic manager martin o'neill said this week that koeman was \"bleating\" about the matter. Keane added: \"maybe everton need to look at their own training schedule.\" Mccarthy, 25, has been ruled out of the republic's world cup qualifier against austria on saturday because of a hamstring injury. He has missed most of his club's season because of injury but played in the republic's qualifier wins over georgia and moldova last month. That angered everton boss koeman, who has only seen mccarthy play 33 minutes of competitive action for the premier league club since then. However, keane says he \"could not care less\" about koeman's concerns - and also criticised previous toffees manager roberto martinez. \"everton traditionally have always had brilliant irish players doing well for the football club, so they shouldn't be so quick to stop irish players coming to play for ireland,\" said the former manchester united midfielder. \"we have had a problem previously with martinez - i think he was slightly over the top. \"every time, we felt, the everton players were turning up - and this is not a criticism of the players, this is more from everton and their staff - they were always carrying knocks. \"i always felt the everton players were going to turn up on crutches or crawling in the hotel door, and now it looks like we are probably going to have that issue again with koeman.

But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video. Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the natural history museum in london, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to europe by modern humans as they migrated out of africa. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from cambridge university and oxford brookes university say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of neanderthals. It has been around 30, 000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co - existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning europeans now have roughly two per cent neanderthal dna. These `legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our hla system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside africa are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with neanderthals.

    "result": "```\nError 1:\nLocation: \"was rescued by a storm in norfolk, virginia\"\nExplanation: This phrase contains two factual consistency errors. Firstly, Louis Jordan was not rescued **by** a storm, but rather **after** surviving multiple storms at sea. Secondly, the rescue location is implied to be Norfolk, Virginia, but the article only mentions \"hundreds of miles from land\" and \"off the coast of the Carolinas\" without specifying the exact rescue location as Norfolk, Virginia (only mentioned as part of the CNN attribution).\nSeverity: 4\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"The crew of the houston express container ship was a yacht\"\nExplanation: This statement is factually inconsistent with the article. According to the article, it was the **small boat** (later identified as Louis Jordan's sailboat) that was initially thought to be a wrecked **yacht** by the crew of the Houston Express, not the Houston Express itself.\nSeverity: 5\n\nError 3:\nLocation: \"It was a man on it for help\"\nExplanation: While this phrase attempts to convey that there was a man on the boat signaling for help, its construction is ambiguous and could be misinterpreted. However, the primary issue here is factual consistency, and in this context, the error is more about omission and clarity rather than direct factual inconsistency with the provided article text. Yet, considering the strict format, it's acknowledged but would typically fall under a different evaluation criterion (coherence/fluidity). Given the instructions, if we strictly interpret for **factual consistency** as per the rules, this might not qualify, but to follow your format and highlight the confusion:\nSeverity: N/A (Under Factual Consistency Rules) - **But if evaluating clarity/cohesion, Severity would be 2**\n\nOverall score: Unacceptable\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains severe factual inconsistencies that significantly alter the understanding of the original article's events, including misattributing the rescue circumstances and incorrectly identifying the Houston Express as a yacht. These errors demonstrate a substantial deviation from factual consistency, warranting an \"Unacceptable\" rating.\n```"

On one occasion there was only one commode available for more than 100 patients at north middlesex university hospital, a report by the watchdog said. Emergency services at the london hospital have been rated \"inadequate\". The hospital said it was \"extremely sorry\" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the care quality commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in april and may. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the a&e department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other london trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief inspector of hospitals sir mike richards said the hospital has already \"turned a corner\" since the inspection. He said: \"a new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and i note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to a and e which is so badly needed. \"there is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely.\" David burrowes, mp for enfield southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014. He said \"urgent action\" was needed. \"the important question is why the warning signals from at least two years ago were not heeded,\" he added. Tottenham mp david lammy said the \"damning\" report is \"even worse than i feared\" and demanded answers from health secretary jeremy hunt. He said: \"it shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the health secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal.\" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement.

The independent said it had removed all ads on the site while it investigated. \"it appears that an advert appearing on that blogsite may have included malware,\" said a spokesman for the newspaper. \"there is no suggestion or evidence that any of our users have been affected by this.\" The spokesman said the site affected was an old or \"legacy\" system that was now rarely visited. According to trend micro, the ransomware has been present on the independent blogs website since at least 21 november. \"we reported it to them on tuesday - but, as of today, it is still happening,\" said raimund genes, chief technical officer at trend micro. \"now we need to go public to warn people who are not using security software like ours.\" The malware exploits a security hole in adobe flash player to install itself on a victim's computer. Once downloaded, it sets about encrypting documents, rendering them useless without the key to decrypt them, for which it demands a ransom. The vulnerability in flash has since been patched, but anybody using an old version of the web browser plug-in could still be at risk. \"for a while on tuesday, the malware didn't trigger. But that was not the independent solving it, it was the attackers updating the malware with a new version,\" said mr genes. \"my advice is to update your flash player.

Mr tucker will take over on 1 october, succeeding douglas flint who has been in the role since 2010. The appointment breaks an hsbc tradition of appointing insiders to the chairmanship. One of his first jobs will be to find a replacement for stuart gulliver, the chief executive of hsbc, who plans to step down next year. While hsbc is europe's biggest bank, the bulk of its profits are generated in asia. Mr tucker has been chief executive of aia for seven years, during which he oversaw the insurer's expansion in asia. Before aia, he was the chief executive of insurance giant prudential, and brings to hsbc his experience at the top of a uk financial giant as well as his asian exposure. Richard dunbar of aberdeen asset management, told the bbc the bank has \"obviously decided\" that an external perspective would be useful to hsbc at this time. He added that while chief executive of prudential, mr tucker did a good job of expanding its asian assets, which are seen as the firm's \"jewel in the crown\". Hsbc has been through an overhaul in recent years in an attempt to reverse declining profits. Over the past six years it has cut more than 40,000 jobs and sold off businesses. Despite those efforts, profits tumbled more than 60% last year. The banking industry has been hampered by the extended period of very low interest rates, which makes lending money less profitable. For hsbc, that problem has been compounded by its move into less risky areas of banking since the financial crisis which started in 2007.

Roberts-jones, 29, was cleared of sexually assaulting two other girls at a summer ball and a camping trip by a jury in february at exeter crown court. He was a physics teacher at the \u00e2\u00a331,000 a year school but now lives in france.

In may 2014, he offered to give his victim a massage after she suffered cramp but went on to lift her top and try to pull down her trousers. Recorder mr philip mott, qc said there was a \"higher culpability because of the abuse of trust\". He said: \"this was not just flirting and an error of judgment but a more determined effort to pursue your desire and overcome her resistance.\" The judge said roberts-jones, who now teaches adults in france, had experienced \"substantial punishment in terms of career, self image and place in society\" and suspended his sentence for two years.

Sick : around 56, 000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014. Unlike crufts prizewinner jagger the irish setter, who died last month after eating meat laced with poison, most poisoned pets will simply have eaten something they found lying around the home or fallen ill after being fed treats by their well - meaning owners. Painkillers were the most common cause of poisoning, followed by rat and mouse bait and chocolate - - which can cause sickness, diarrhoea and fits and trigger heart problems. Dark chocolate is particularly toxic. Foods such as sultanas, grapes and raisins are also highly dangerous for dogs, causing canine kidneys to fail. Dried forms of the fruit found in cakes are the most toxic. Onions, garlic and leeks can cause life - threatening anaemia. Nick sutton, a kennel club poisons expert, said : `there are any number of ways a dog can get access to dangerous and potentially lethal substances, whether by accident, deliberate feeding or through owners mistakenly believing certain products - - particularly foods eaten by humans - - are fine for a dog to eat. ` many seemingly harmless foods can be dangerous for a dog and owners need to be aware of these risks in order to protect their much - loved pets.'

Carl tremarco scored a well-worked goal on the break to give the visitors a half-time lead. That was extended early in the second period when miles storey's effort found the net via the post before josh meekings side-footed a third. Kris doolan's consolation gave home fans something to clap but jordan roberts notched a fourth for caley. It was an unusually abject performance from the glasgow jags, who were booed several times by their own fans and now sit six points ahead of the relegation zone with three games left. Media playback is not supported on this device. The match doubled as a bit of window shopping for caley thistle boss john hughes, who has eyes for a few out-of-contract partick players. One of them is steven lawless, who should have done better with a left-foot shot that he dragged wide following some combative work by ryan edwards. Partick's pre-match guide pointed out that the hosts had not scored a first-half goal at firhill since 16 january, and it would be the visitors who hit the back of the net in the opening 45 minutes this time round in maryhill. Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by andrea mbuyi-mutombo released tremarco. At first it seemed the englishman was not sure what to do as he surged down the left, but he took the correct decision to plough on ahead and send a lovely finish into the far corner with the inside of his left boot. Sean welsh watched his free-kick well saved by the diving owain fon williams in the inverness goalmouth soon after. Matters did not improve for the hosts after the break. Caley thistle immediately extended their lead when meekings found storey at the right edge of the box. Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan swindon town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle. The firhill crowd got even more uneasy when roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by mbuyi-mutombo, then partick goalkeeper ryan scully had to pull off a great stop to deny storey getting his second of the afternoon. When roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos. Meekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from greg tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for inverness. Doolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding fon williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead. Richie foran - who has had so many injury problems over the last two years - came on as a substitute and delivered a cross for roberts to slam home at the back post and remind everyone which team had been in complete control."

Spencer wilding, who hails from rhyl, was the guest of honour at a special screening of rogue one. He had to muster all powers of the force to keep his vader role secret until the film's release. \"it's a hell of a secret to keep,\" said wilding, who was cast as the body actor for the role. \"but when you're a professional actor - when you sign that black and white sheet of paper saying you cannot say a word... I'm true to my word and i didn't say anything.\" Speaking to bbc radio wales' good morning wales programme, the 44-year-old said it proved a tricky task after rumours of the role leaked a year ago. \"i've been having hundreds of people every day for a year asking me if i'm vader,\" he said. \"if i had a pound for everyone who asked i'd be buying myself a new death star - and it'd be gold plated.\" The 6ft 7in (2m) tall actor already has a string of hollywood appearances to his name, including guardians of the galaxy, green lantern, three harry potter films and the tv blockbuster game of thrones. He said the vader role came from a regular casting call, first with a self-filmed tape, then a recall to pinewood studios. \"it's very, very secretive. We didn't even know exactly what the character was and what film it was until we got there,\" he said. \"i opened up the curtain when i went in the dressing room and there he was - vader. \"anybody out there who got into that costume and got an audition to be darth vader alone is very exciting, so to pull the character off as well, it's like'what!' \"i'm always pinching myself - i am definitely awake - it is not a dream, it is just another dream come true.\" While the actor has the body role, just like his predecessor in the original star wars films david prowse, the voice of lord vader is actor james earl jones.

Flower, 26, punched hohaia to the ground two minutes into saturday's grand final, then landed a second blow to his face while he lay on the ground. Wales prop flower was sent off as the warriors were beaten 14-6. The ban until 14 april takes in 10 super league games and the world club series match against brisbane broncos. New zealander hohaia had already accepted a one-game suspension for a forearm strike which came before flower's punches. Flower was charged with a grade f offence - the most serious in the sport's disciplinary rules - of \"violent and aggressive punching\" and \"punching an off-guard opponent\", a charge which carries a minimum of an eight-game ban. Wigan rugby general manager kris radlinski, who accompanied flower to the hearing at the rugby football league in leeds, said in a statement: \"wigan warriors would like to go on record in saying that the rfl disciplinary committee handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity. \"we fully support their assessment of saturday night's incident involving our player, ben flower. We will be making no appeal. \"we would like to apologise to lance hohaia and his family and to the st helens club and fans. St helens' win on saturday has been overshadowed by the incident and that is wrong.\" In becoming the first man to be sent off in a grand final, flower left his side down to 12 men for the vast majority of the match at old trafford, which st helens won to end an eight-year wait for the super league title. Saints chairman eamonn mcmanus said: \"the sport of rugby league should not be judged by this event, but by how it deals with it. \"we must assist [flower] in any way that we can and accept him back into the sport. There is a person behind the player, and i am reliably informed by all that it is a good one.\" For wigan, the defeat ended their defence of the super league crown and the pursuit of a fourth title. Former wigan and great britain player martin offiah told bbc radio 5 live: \"there is a lot of emotion around what was a big occasion but sadly it was in effect ruined by this incident in which i believe both players played their part. It was a sad day for rugby league. \"the sport was on show, it's a big event and the pictures are very graphic and all the apologies in the world won't wipe these away. \"no one can condone that second punch to the head and he's apologised for that but lance hohaia must take some consideration for his actions.\" Meanwhile, greater manchester police said in a tweet they are investigating \"abusive social media activity\" surrounding the grand final."

Convicted murderer sweat, 35, was shot twice and captured less than two miles (3km) from the canadian border. His prison-break partner richard matt, 49, was killed by police on friday. The two murderers escaped three weeks ago from the maximum security clinton correctional facility in dannemora through the sewer system after using power tools to break out of their cell. The spectacular escape set off a massive manhunt. Sweat was shot and seized in the town of constable on sunday, new york state governor andrew cuomo told a news conference. He said sweat was shot twice in the torso and was now in hospital in stable condition. The convict was spotted by a police officer on patrol and shot when he tried to run away. \"the nightmare is finally over,\" the governor said. Meanwhile, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives wrote on its twitter page: \"$davidsweat of the $prisonbreakny captured.

Matt was shot dead near the town of malone. The pair had been making their way through rugged forests in upstate new york, stealing food and guns from woodland cabins along the way. Us officials have charged prison worker joyce mitchell with aiding the two inmates in their escape. Prosecutors allege that she gave the men power tools that allowed them to saw through a steel cell wall before bashing a hole through a brick wall and crawling through. Ms mitchell denies the charges. Clinton correction officer gene palmer is also accused of aiding the convicts. Officials allege that he gave sweat and matt the frozen hamburger meat ms mitchell had used to hide hacksaw blades and a screwdriver. Mr palmer's attorney said his client had no knowledge that the meat contained the escape tools. Matt was serving a prison sentence of 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss. Sweat was serving a life sentence for murdering a sheriff's deputy. Manhunt timeline."

The very large array (vla) traced the presence of ammonia in the gas giant to study the circulation systems below the visible cloud tops. For features such as the planet's great red spot - a huge storm that has raged for at least 400 years - the scientists can see something of its roots. The observations go many tens of kilometres into the atmosphere. \"what really excites me is just the level of detail we see,\" said team-member michael wong from the university of california, berkeley. \"in our maps you can see different zones, turbulent features, vortices - even the great red spot. \"this has all been made possible by an upgrade to the vla and a new technique developed by one of our co-workers,\" he told bbc news. The karl g jansky very large array is based in the desert of new mexico, close to the town of socorro. As its name suggests, it is multi-antenna telescope. The upgrade dr wong is referring to has made the facility a far more sensitive tool for studying the radio emissions coming from objects in space. And the new technique he mentions counters the smearing effect you would ordinarily expect to get if you took a long exposure of a rapidly rotating body (jupiter's \"day\" lasts just 10 hours). The result is a wonderfully detailed impression of what is happening under the immediate surface of the many-banded weather systems that race across the top of planet's atmosphere. The team looks at the glow of ammonia because it is a tracer for the dynamical flow in the planet's gases, which are dominated by hydrogen and helium. At earth, you might do something similar by using water as the tracer. \"we see the actual glow of the ammonia itself, and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness,\" explained dr wong. \"the deepest we can see in this dataset is about 12 bar - 12 times the earth's atmospheric pressure.\" Plumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves. The team writes in the journal science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes, and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the galileo spacecraft in the 1990s. \"all told, there is a wealth of information about the structure of jupiter's atmosphere in these new vla images,\" said imke de pater, the lead author on the science paper. \"we hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these and future studies using similar techniques.\" Prof de pater wants to try similar observations at the gas giants saturn and uranus. The research is a nice prelude to the next probe set to visit jupiter: the us space agency satellite juno arrives at the enormous planet on 4 july. Its remote sensing instruments aim to characterise the full internal structure of the planet, right down to its rocky core - if indeed it has one.

And considering the 27 - year - old yorkshireman finished joint 12th following a closing round of 68 on the blue monster, perhaps it is not too fanciful to suggest willett could become the first masters debutant to slip on the green jacket since fuzzy zoeller in 1979. ` i've always said if you're not going to go to an event and be fully prepared to try to win, there is no point going,' willett said. Danny willett is aiming to become the first debutant to win the masters since fuzzy zoeller in 1979. Willett insists he is preparing to emerge victorious in the first major of 2015. Fuzzy zoeller won on his augusta debut in 1979 and willett is looking to emulate his achievements. ` you don't pitch up to try to finish 15th, 30th or just try to make the cut ; you try to go and win regardless of the field or whatever.

A certain rory mcilroy might have something to say about such lofty ambitions next week, but willett is very well aware of what the world number one is capable of from their amateur days.

Lon snowden told journalists in moscow he felt \"extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free\". He later met his son, local media say. Edward snowden was granted asylum in russia in august after weeks spent in a transit zone at moscow airport when the us revoked his travel documents. The 30-year-old leaked many thousands of us intelligence documents. The information, published in the guardian and washington post newspapers, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by both us and british intelligence. In the us, edward snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Meanwhile, edward snowden met four former us security officials in russia late on wednesday, it has emerged. The officials - who now campaign against what they describe as the misuse of state secrecy - said they had presented mr snowden with the sam adams associates for integrity in intelligence award. The award is given annually by a group of retired cia officers. The officials told russian media mr snowden had no regrets about leaking the classified files and was convinced he had done the right thing. \"he's remarkably centred,\" ex-fbi agent coleen rowley told state-funded rt television. 'legal options' lon snowden, arriving at moscow's sheremetyevo airport on thursday, was met by his son's russian lawyer, anatoly kucherena. \"i'm here to learn more about my son's situation,\" mr snowden told reporters. \"my hope is to learn more about his circumstances and his health and to discuss legal options.\" \"if the opportunity presents itself, i certainly hope that i have the opportunity to see my son,\" he said in televised remarks. \"i'm not sure that my son will be returning to the us. That's his decision, he's an adult.\" Lon snowden later visited his son, but the place and time of the meeting \"are not being been revealed for security reasons\", said russia's state-run tv channels rossiya 24 and channel one. Lon snowden has in the past praised his son for speaking \"the truth\" and making great sacrifices, and has spoken of his concern that he would not face a fair trial if he returned to the us. Edward snowden accessed many of the documents while working for the defence contractor booz allen hamilton in hawaii, where he had been living with his girlfriend. As the revelations became public, mr snowden fled to hong kong where, with his consent, the guardian revealed his identity in june. To escape us attempts to extradite him, mr snowden moved on to russia where he remained in the transit zone of sheremetyevo airport until russia granted him asylum. Russia's move added to already tense relations with the us. Washington cancelled a bilateral summit in september."

According to a wall street journal report thursday, chinese nuclear experts have told the united states that pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads. And while that number may seem stunning, it is actually only part of a troubling story. The key takeaway from the latest assessment of north korea's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads, but the type of warhead, as this gives a better clue to the future of the country's weapons capabilities. True, the reported chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear `` arsenal.' ' however, this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by u. S. And other experts. The big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that north korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium. If that assessment is correct, and pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium, then the plutonium program that the u. S. And members of the six - party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial. After all, the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually. This news could be much more serious. Why? For a start, it would mean that north korea's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition, if it had not already, of a runaway nuclear weapons program, with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in north korea's mines.

    "result": "```\nError 1:\nLocation: \"Chinese estimate of 20 warheads is in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons-grade uranium.\"\nExplanation: This statement misrepresents the original article. The article states that North Korea, not the Chinese estimate, has the potential to double its arsenal by next year with weapons-grade uranium. The Chinese estimate only provides the current number of warheads (20). This alteration changes the subject and implies an incorrect relationship between the estimate and the doubling of the arsenal.\nSeverity: 4\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"Plutonium program at yongbyon has no detectable heat signature or topographic profile.\"\nExplanation: The original article actually states that the uranium-based program (with thousands of centrifuges) has no detectable profile, not the plutonium program. This error swaps the characteristics between the two types of programs, leading to factual inconsistency.\nSeverity: 5\n\nOverall score: Poor\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains two significant errors related to factual consistency. Error 1 distorts the relationship between a reported estimate and North Korea's nuclear capabilities, while Error 2 incorrectly attributes a characteristic to the wrong program (plutonium instead of uranium), leading to a misunderstanding of the original article's key points.

They were arrested as part of operation captura, a drive launched in 2006 by the national crime agency, crimestoppers and spanish authorities to catch suspects who had fled from the uk. Jayson mcdonald ( right ) is wanted on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine, and is believed to be a member of a europe - wide organised crime network. Paul monk ( left ) was wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to supply cannabis. Monk, 54, from romford in essex was overseeing workmen laying a marble patio around his swimming pool when armed police swooped at the address where an imitation firearm with silencer and 125, 000 euro were recovered.

He denied misconduct and said it was mutual flirting at an east midlands ambulance service base in lincolnshire. The panel said his actions in 2015 were so serious it had to suspend him. The tribunal hearing on 4 april was told that mr warwick had removed a pen from the'v' of his colleague's blouse and squeezed her breast when he placed the pen back into her blouse. On another occasion mr warwick told the complainant he \"needed a hug\". He started working at the spalding station in august 2014 and claimed both he and his colleague had \"engaged in flirtatious behaviour\". In reaching its conclusion the hcpc said the panel acknowledged mr warwick was \"of good character\", with an \"otherwise unblemished career\". It also accepted that he had apologised to the complainant shortly afterwards. Panel chair claire bonnet said: \"mr warwick had demonstrated limited insight into how his actions transgressed professional boundaries. \"his misconduct was so serious that the need to uphold professional standards and public confidence in the profession and the regulatory process would be undermined if a finding of impairment was not made in these circumstances,\" she added."

Fire, police and coastguard teams were called to butley creek near orford, suffolk, on wednesday by a member of the public who had seen the supine figure of a man lying in the water. The \"body\" turned out to be a work of art called a thousand tides, which has been at the site for more than a year. A suffolk police spokesman described the work as \"quite realistic\". Read more suffolk stories here. The sculpture, by artist laurence edwards, was designed to only be seen at low tide and was intended to sink eventually. However, mr edwards said it had \"stayed on the surface longer than it should\". He said: \"i've always been a bit worried that a helicopter would spot it and want to rescue it. \"to convince someone it's a real person is a great achievement, although i would like to apologise to the poor person who called it in.\" The sculpture was a parting gift to the area from mr edwards, who had a studio and foundry works nearby for 15 years until spring 2016 before moving to halesworth. Mr edwards' website says his work \"attempts to do justice to the locality and its history, by peopling it with large figures that have survived the ravages of the water and the elements.\" Suffolk police confirmed they attended butley creek, saying: \"police received a call from a member of the public reporting what they believed to be a body in the river. \"the fire service and coastguard were also called to assist, but a short while later this was actually confirmed to be a sculpture.\" A thousand tides is reminiscent of antony gormley's another place installation on crosby beach in merseyside, which depicts 100 bronze figures looking out over the irish sea."

Most, if not all, members of the scheme would see a reduction in benefits. Those under retirement age would receive an immediate 10% cut in their pension pot. In addition, annual payments to most members, including those already retired, would be less in the ppf than if the hoover scheme continued. At about \u00a3500m, the pension scheme is roughly the same size as bhs. Bhs pensions is already receiving compensation from ppf which acts as a lifeboat for pensions so people are paid even when a company goes bust or is about to and if there are insufficient assets in the scheme. Bhs is being assessed for take-over by the organisation. The hoover scheme has a deficit of about \u00a3250m.

However, according to the article, Zeynab was killed on April 7 while trying to escape, which aligns with the timeline but doesn't necessarily clarify if she was among those fleeing after ISIS took control. The issue is more about potential implication rather than a direct factual inconsistency regarding Zeynab.\nSeverity: 1 (Borderline, as it's more about summary choice than factual error)\n\nOverall score: Good\nExplanation of the score: Despite two identified errors, both are of relatively low severity. Error 1 slightly misrepresents the context of Zeynab's movement but does not fundamentally alter the facts of her death. Error 2 is more about the summary's structure and implication rather than a direct factual inconsistency. The core facts about Zeynab's death (age, cause, location, and date) are accurately preserved in the summary, leading to an overall 'Good' score for factual consistency.\n```"

      "Article": "Talks between greece and its european creditors on a third \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn; $94bn) bailout have been delayed due to logistical problems, officials say. Greek officials had been expected to meet representatives of eu creditors in the greek capital athens on friday. But a european commission spokeswoman later said those representatives would arrive \"in the coming days\". Separately, greece formally submitted a request for a new loan from the international monetary fund (imf). In a letter to imf head christine lagarde dated 23 july but released to the public on friday, greek finance minister euclid tsakalotos wrote that athens was \"seeking a new loan\". Greece had initially planned not to ask the imf for more funds, reports say. Greek mps have approved tough new conditions set by the eu lenders for talks on the bailout. It is unclear when imf officials will be joining the negotiations. The washington-based imf wants greece's debt burden to be reduced to a level it considers \"sustainable\", but it faces resistance from reluctant european partners. Eu officials said on friday that there were \"logistical issues to solve\" before high-level talks with athens could begin, but that negotiations were taking place at a technical level. The greek team had been expected to meet top representatives from the european commission, european central bank (ecb) and european stability mechanism (esm) - the eurozone's main bailout fund. Talks on the bailout package are expected to last a month. Tight capital controls, introduced at the end of june, remain in place to prevent a run on greece's cash-strapped banks. Pm tsipras faced a backlash from mps in his own left-wing syriza party, during two parliamentary votes on austerity measures required by the creditors in order for negotiations to start. But he secured parliament's backing after a second crucial vote passed early on thursday. The reforms debated this week included changes to greek banking and an overhaul of the judiciary. Last week, greece passed an initial set of austerity measures, including tax rises and pushing back the retirement age. Mr tsipras has said that he is not happy with the measures imposed by creditors but that his government was forced to choose a \"difficult compromise\" to avoid greece exiting the eurozone. A decision on more contentious measures - phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers - has been pushed back to august. Demonstrations have taken place on the streets of athens against the bailout deal and trade unions have taken strike action. On wednesday, the ecb increased its cash lifeline to greek banks by \u20ac900m - the second rise in a week. The imf confirmed on monday that greece had cleared its overdue debt repayments of \u20ac2.05bn and was no longer in arrears. The repayments, which included \u20ac4.2bn to the ecb, were made possible by a short-term eu loan of \u20ac7.16bn. Greece's next major deadline is 20 august, when it must pay \u20ac3.2bn owed to the ecb, followed by a payment of \u20ac1.5bn to the imf in september."

Elin jones is expected to lay out plans where some areas of welsh forest could be transferred to the private sector or to not for profit organisations. But she has already ruled out the widespread sale of welsh woodlands. Forestry commission wales said it would explore the feasibility of transfer to the private sector case by case. The minister told bbc radio wales she plans to \"compensate\" the public by buying new land for new planting or management if any forest was sold off on a case-by-case basis. \"i don't want any stagnancy in the forest estate. I want it to work for public benefit whether that's economic or environmental or access benefit,\" she said. \"it's my view there should be no reduction in the publicly owned estate and i have asked the forestry commission to look at how it can make that estate work harder, provide a better return for the public. \"whether that's in terms of public access, in terms of environmental benefit in the production of renewable energy or biomass potential or also in terms of the economic return from that forestry estate.\" The minister is due to outline her plans to ams during tuesday's plenary session in the senedd. Further commercialisation being planned would include partnerships with the private sector for more forest holidays, wind farms and limited extraction of coalfield methane. Around 37% of welsh woodland comes under the assembly government woodland estate (agwe). A report commissioned by the assembly examined a number of options, including a complete sell-off of the land to the private sector or a not-for-profit trust. It warned there were potential difficulties with both of these, instead recommending that a case-by-case approach should be taken to the future of wales' forests. Jerry langford, the woodland trust's director in wales gave a guarded welcome and said the plans were \"considered and enlightened\". \"if these changes do lead to more native woodland creation and a new urgency for the restoration of ancient woodlands planted with conifers, this could be the start of a new'age of the tree' in wales,\" he said. Any sell-off in wales would release resources to the fc to purchase other areas of land not currently under its management to increase their public benefit. Overall, there would be no reduction in the size of the welsh forests in public ownership. The report states: \"the minister agreed that fc wales should adopt whenever possible a more commercial approach to its management of the estate and in particular to be pro-active and imaginative in exploring opportunities for deeper commercialisation when dealing with the private sector.\" Forestry commission wales said it would \"explore the feasibility of small-scale transfer to the third sector on a case by case basis\". A spokesman said: \"this would be subject to proper safeguards being in place to ensure that the woodland continues to be sustainably managed and that it can continue to deliver key benefits such as access for the public.\""

    "result": "```\nError 1:\nLocation: \"Daughters of sir paul's first wife linda died of cancer four years previously.\"\nExplanation: This statement is factually inconsistent because it implies that the daughters (Stella and Mary) died of cancer, whereas the article actually states that Sir Paul's first wife, Linda, died of cancer four years previously.

The summary incorrectly implies that only the year of divorce (2008) is relevant to Sir Paul's age at the time of the event described (the wedding), which was actually in 2002 when he was 59.\nSeverity: 3\n\nOverall score: Poor\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains significant factual inconsistencies, including a severe error that completely misrepresents the subject of death (Error 1) and a moderate error that omits crucial context (Error 2).

This detail about the image is not relevant to the factual consistency of the event summary.

The article implies the dogs were shot after escaping onto the neighbor's land where they were **accused** of killing birds previously (with a specific incident involving another dog, Ruby, mentioned).

For many, the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the mediterranean this week will come as a welcome relief. But for millions, the first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dreaded cloud of invisible pollen descends. Experts told mailonline that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms - which include streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time. Around 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year, experts told mailonline. And by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31. 8 million sufferers. Dr jean emberlin, a leading pollen expert, told mailonline that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur, `depending on weather conditions'. She said : `if we get prolonged periods of warm, dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between, which helps the grass to keep growing, we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts. ` grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the uk. ` high and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before. She added : `in addition, the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution, which can make symptoms worse, and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before.' In addition, she said pollen is becoming more potent, and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers. Dr emberlin said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer, typically stretching from april to the end of august"

Washington blamed russia and the syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the us warned it would halt the talks unless moscow stops bombing the city of aleppo. Russia said it regretted the us move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john kirby said: \"the united states is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"unfortunately, russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which moscow agreed. \"rather, russia and the syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" mr kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said moscow and syrian president bashar al-assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 september attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the us suspension of the talks, russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said: \"we regret this decision by washington.\" \"washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around aleppo. \"after failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" ms zakharova said. She also said that the us had failed to divide jihadist groups in syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the us were due to convene in geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but american officials were told to return home. The us also said that it would withdraw personnel \"that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the joint (us-russian) implementation centre\". However, the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in syria to avoid unnecessary clashes."

A serial pedophile in florida has been arrested for molesting at least seven young children in his apartment complex just 18 months after he was released from prison by officials who voted to give him a second chance. Michael shepard, 35, conned parents into letting him babysit their kids and was frequently seen riding around the neighborhood with children on his scooter, authorities say. When asked about the sex offender notification he gave to his neighbors, he claimed that he had been in prison for a `romeo and juliet romance' with a preacher's daughter. Police now say he did everything he could to win the confidence of the parents at cedar hollow apartments in pinellas park so that he could prey on their children. He is accused of horrific sexual attacks on seven children, both boys and girls. His youngest alleged victim is five years old. All of them were age 12 or younger. Detectives say he tempted them with video games, candy and trips to mcdonald's. He also drove young children to his `hideout' in the woods where he allegedly forced them to perform sexual acts on him and raped them. Parents even let their children sleep over at his apartment. The tampa bay times reports that shepard, who has a history of molesting children dating back 20 years, served 15 years in prison for molesting two boys, age six and nine, at a roller rink in 1998. As his term in prison neared its end, authorities filed petitions to keep him locked up under the jimmy ryce act, a florida law that allows sex offenders to be kept behind bars past their sentences if they're likely to re - offend. Shepard posted these sex offender notifications around his apartment complex, but told parents he was convicted of sleeping with a preacher's teenage daughter.

In the aftermath of khalid masood's assault on london, the bbc received a number of questions from people concerned about safety and security on our streets. Here, bbc london's home affairs correspondent nick beake answers the most popular. Why don't the unarmed police officers at westminster have protective body gear, stab- or bulletproof vests? And do they carry tasers? Nick beake: pc keith palmer was an unarmed officer protecting the palace of westminster, but scotland yard says he was wearing a protective vest at the time of the attack. The force said during the post-mortem examination \"the pathologist could find no obvious evidence of damage or penetration other than the vest having been cut off during emergency first aid at the scene\". Armed officers working at parliament carry a primary weapon, a sidearm and a taser. And an unspecified number of armed response vehicles - three firearms specialists in an unmarked car - are on constant patrol in central london. Will the pavement safety barriers removed from nearby london bridge be restored? Nick beake: the use of safety barriers varies from location to location. The police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public. The mayor of london's office says it is currently considering where more barriers could be installed. Why not build a 6in [15cm] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic? Nick beake: an independent review commissioned by the mayor of london, sadiq khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of london to protect pedestrians from a nice- or berlin-style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds. The report author, lord harris of haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events. What is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack? Nick beake: the current terrorist threat is rated as \"severe\", which means an attack is highly likely. The latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if that is not possible, and then tell the authorities: \"run, hide, tell.\" More information can be found on the gov.uk website. What should we do if we see something suspicious? Nick beake: if you spot something suspicious, ring the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321. And call 999 if you think there is an immediate threat. How do we know if something that seems suspicious is actually terrorism-related? Nick beake: it can be hard for experienced police and other investigators to establish quickly if a threat is terrorist-related, but the authorities would rather the public contact them with their genuine concerns however small they may be. It's better to be safe than sorry."

The international federation for human rights (fidh) said some people were killed simply because they did not have identity documents. A malian army officer was quoted as denying the allegations. Meanwhile, the un says 7,100 civilians have fled to neighbouring states since 10 january to escape fighting. Reports suggesting that the mainly black african malian army, drawn largely from the south, has targeted arabs and ethnic tuaregs from the north expose a racial aspect to the war here which has been hidden by the emphasis on western troops fighting a war against islamist insurgents, the bbc's mark doyle in mali says. France intervened militarily on 11 january to halt a militant advance. It said al-qaeda linked islamists - some of whom were foreigners - threatened to turn mali into a \"terrorist state\". It has bombed suspected rebel positions and deployed about 2,000 troops to help the weak malian army recapture territory. Fidh said there needed to be an independent investigation into alleged abuses committed by malian soldiers and those responsible should be punished. In the garrison town of sevare, at least seven people were executed at a military camp, near a bus station and a hospital, it said. There was \"credible information\" pointing to 20 other executions in sevare, with bodies \"buried hastily, notably in wells\", fidh said. Summary killings also took place in the towns of mopti and niono, the group added. \"other allegations of summary executions continue to come from all areas of the west and centre of the country,\" it said. It added that some of the victims were accused of possessing weapons, and of being \"infiltrators\" and \"accomplices\" of the militants. Others were killed because they did not have identity documents or simply because of their ethnicity, fidh said. Dozens of ethnic tuaregs in mali's capital, bamako, have also had their homes raided by troops, the group added. Voices from diabaly after rebel battle. The malian army's capt modibo traore said the allegations were \"completely false\" but declined to comment further, ap news agency reports. United nations refugee agency (unhcr) regional coordinator valentin tapsoba said 7,100 people had fled to neighbouring countries in the last two weeks to escape fighting. Most of them - some 4,000 - had fled to mauritania, mali's western neighbour, mr tapsoba told the bbc's focus on africa programme. He said a further 3,100 people had crossed into burkina faso and chad, to the east of mali. Nearly 10,000 have also also moved into camps inside mali since 10 january, he said. The latest conflict erupted after the militants advanced southwards, attacking the central towns of konna, diabaly and douentza. French officials say their forces have helped malian troops to recapture all three towns. France hopes to hand command of the operation to a west african force, which currently has some 1,000 soldiers on the ground."

      "Article": "How neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians. One theory is that early modern humans `bullied' their neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive. But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals. The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture, living in south and west europe and west asia around 40, 000 years ago. They found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthal - created tools of the same era. Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought. Traditionally, scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of africa to europe. But the new study by nagoya university and the university of tokyo in japan argues neanderthals were just as well - equipped as their human counterparts. ` we're not so special, i don't think we survived neanderthals simply because of technological competence,' said dr seiji kadowaki, first author of the study from nagoya university, japan. On the left is a map of the levant showing the locations of the early ahmarian - related sites analysed in this study. Neanderthals ( reconstruction right ) may not have been as dim - witted as first believe, claims the study. The early ahmarian culture used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears. Researchers previously considered these to be an important innovation - one that helped the humans migrate from west asia to europe, where neanderthals were living. Early modern humans expanded the geographic area they inhabited out of africa during a period of time"

But the lga said councils would still face a combined shortfall of \u00a36.8bn by the end of the parliament. The government said council tax was expected to be lower in real terms in 2020 than a decade earlier. In the spending review, chancellor george osborne said local authorities responsible for adult social care would be allowed to increase council tax by 2% above existing limits. By adding in the maximum new levies allowable without a referendum, the lga estimated that band d bills could cost an average of just under \u00a3200 more over the next five years. It said this would not be enough, particularly as budgets continued to face new pressures such as those caused by an aging population. Any shortfall might have to be made up by further increases to costs such as car parking charges, it added.

Those arrested include two builders, police officers and municipality officials. The apartment building came crashing down on thursday. Correspondents say building collapses are common in india, with poor construction practices often blamed. In pictures: mumbai building collapse. There is huge demand for housing, and corruption often leads to cost-cutting and a lack of safety inspections, correspondents say. Police commissioner k p raghuvanshi said the builders were arrested for allegedly paying bribes to police and municipal officials to construct the building in the mumbai suburb of thane without any official sanction. Mr raghuvanshi said on sunday that the nine would be formally charged with culpable homicide and causing death by negligence, once the investigation into the accident had been completed. If convicted, they face sentences of up to life in prison. Most of the victims of the thane collapse were poor daily wage earners working at the site, and their families. The dead included 30 children and 18 women. Building work had continued at the block even though four floors were already occupied. One police official told the bbc that the collapse appeared to have been caused by the use of substandard building material. Witnesses said the construction of the building started just six weeks ago, since when seven floors had been built. The eighth floor was under construction. In a similar collapse in 2010, 69 people were killed in delhi."

The nhs information centre data shows more than eight out of 10 newborns are now breastfed at least once after birth, up from six out of 10 in 1990. Experts said the increase was welcome and partly due to public awareness that \"breast is best\" for mother and child. But the figures do not reveal how many mums stick at it for the recommended first six months of a baby's life. Many women struggle to continue to exclusively breastfeed. And the royal college of midwives is concerned that some new mothers are not getting the support they need to encourage breastfeeding. Spokeswoman jane munro criticised the department of health in england for axing funding for national breastfeeding awareness week, which runs this week. \"we do not want to see the ground we have gained lost.\" She added: \"we know that many women stop breastfeeding when they leave hospital. \"this is why it is so important that they are able to get advice and support from their midwife, and that there are enough midwives with the time to offer these women the help they need.\" The government said it was committed to training up to an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015 who would \"be able to help support women who want to breastfeed but may find it difficult\".

Morelos is among the worst-affected states in mexico's epidemic of drug-related violence. At least 20,000 people have disappeared across mexico, the un estimates - other organisation put the number far higher.

State prosecutor javier perez duron said an investigation was under way into who was responsible for the illegal mass burial. \"it is extremely important and the highest responsibility to count the bodies and give them a dignified burial,\" mr duron said. Experts from the autonomous university of the state of morelos (uaem) have been called in to help with dna testing.

A top mortgage broker who bragged that he `spared no expense' to build his dream home is facing jail after conning a bank into giving him the money for it. Marcus copeland, 44, splashed out almost $ 1million to complete the six - bedroomed eco house. He sourced specialist scottish stone and installed the latest environmentally friendly technologies to make the house in cwm dyserth, near st asaph, north wales, one of the most `green' new builds in the country. But yesterday it emerged that the married father - of - two's dream had become a nightmare, after he admitted lying on mortgage forms to secure more than $ 800, 000 for the property. At caernarfon crown court the former journalist, who was once named best mortgage broker in the midlands and wales, admitted two counts of fraud by lying to abbey national about the profitability of his business to secure the $ 847, 000 loan in march 2007. At an earlier hearing, he also pleaded guilty to five charges of deception after he used his position to inflate the salaries of five of his clients and help them obtain mortgages totalling $ 686, 000. Jonathan austin, defending, said copeland maintained that all the customers knew he had boosted their wages when making the applications. The barrister added that none of the loans had ever been defaulted upon. ` all these mortgages proved to be affordable,' the barrister said. ` the obligations were met.' Recorder gregory bull qc bailed copeland, of deganwy, llandudno, for sentencing later this year. But he went on to warn him : `you are not to read anything into the likely sentence.

Edward alexander lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at belfast crown court on wednesday. Judge gordon kerr qc said it was the best way of protecting society and helping lee to change his ways. Lee, originally from whitehall square, belfast, but now living in england, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography. The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories. Lee was described by his wife as a being \"loving and normal young man\". Judge kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his \"own strange pleasure\", they were serious matters as \"children were abused for these images to be made\". He added that children would continue to be abused while people like lee continued to view such material, and that \"society would not tolerate such behaviour\". Judge kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist lee or the community. Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images. Earlier, prosecutor simon jenkins said that when police went to lee's then belfast home on 5 june, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for. On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which lee admitted creating. During interview, lee said that he had been downloading images \"for perhaps the last nine years\".

It also reported a 16% jump in full year profit for 2012 to nt$94.8bn. Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and apple is one of its biggest clients. According to some estimates, orders from apple account for almost half of foxconn's total revenue. In the october to december quarter, apple had sold 47.8 million iphones, up from 37 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, the launch of ipad mini, also boosted sales of its tablet pcs - it sold 22.9 million ipads, compared with 15.4 million in the same period in 2011. However, the heavy reliance on apple has also raised concerns that foxconn's growth may slow in the coming months. Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet pcs had seen in recent years could not be sustained. \"in most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage,\" said andrew milroy of consultancy firm frost & sullivan. Mr milroy added that apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. \"they are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as china,\" he said.

While not entirely incorrect, this introduces ambiguity not present in the original text. The article's phrasing implies the death occurred before the start of the described events, not necessarily immediately preceding them.\nSeverity: 2\n\nError 2:\nLocation: None of the other sentences contain factual consistency errors based on the provided rules.\n\nOverall score: Good\nExplanation of the score: The summary is largely factually consistent with the source article. It accurately reports Jimmy Anderson receiving a silver cap for his 100th test and the tribute to Richie Benaud, including the wearing of black armbands. The only identified error (Error 1) is of moderate severity (rated 2 out of 5), as it introduces minor ambiguity rather than outright inaccuracy or omission of critical context. Thus, while not perfect, the summary's factual consistency is satisfactory, warranting a 'Good' overall score.\n```"

      "Article": "A prominent human rights activist in azerbaijan, leyla yunus, has been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in prison for fraud and tax evasion. Her husband, arif yunus, was given seven years on similar charges. They have been in prison since their arrest nearly a year ago. Both still face separate charges of treason, which carries a life sentence. The couple say the case was politically motivated. Azerbaijan has repeatedly jailed human rights activists. President ilham aliyev has ruled azerbaijan since 2003 and has cracked down hard on political opponents. Both leyla, 59, and arif yunus are in poor health - she has diabetes and hepatitis c, while he has a heart condition and has suffered two strokes. Us-based human rights watch condemned their prosecution as a \"despicable political show trial\". Levan asatiani, an azerbaijan researcher at amnesty international, said \"the judicial system has once again revealed itself to be no more than a cynical tool by which president ilham aliyev crushes any dissent\". In a statement to the bbc the azerbaijan government said the court process in the case was \"open and free\". It also said \"the independence of judiciary and the rule of law have been fully guaranteed\" in azerbaijan. Leyla yunus was found guilty of fraud, illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion and falsifying official documents. She is director of the institute for peace and democracy, a human rights group founded in 1995. It has worked with the council of europe - europe's leading human rights watchdog - and other international bodies, informing them about actions to stifle political dissent in azerbaijan. Mrs yunus had been pressing for reconciliation between oil-rich azerbaijan and neighbouring armenia, to defuse their frozen conflict over nagorno-karabakh. Armenian forces took control of the disputed territory in 1994 soon after the break-up of the soviet union. But sporadic clashes continue between them and nearby azeri forces. (update 20 august: this article was amended to add the official viewpoint of the azerbaijan government.)"

However, strictly following the provided definition focusing on \"facts that are not supported by the article,\" this would typically not be counted. Given the strict instructions, this point is acknowledged but not formally counted as an error in this evaluation format.\n\nOverall score: Fair\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains a moderate factual inconsistency regarding the length of Leyla Yunus's prison sentence. While it captures the essence of her being jailed for fraud, the inaccuracy with the sentence duration and the lack of additional contextual information (though not technically an error by the provided definition) prevent the summary from being considered fully factually consistent or excellent.\n```"

Four taliban gunmen were killed in the gunfight after an argument on the outskirts of quetta, a source said. Another report said mullah mansour died but this is unconfirmed. A taliban spokesman denied the gunfight happened. Mullah mansour's appointment prompted splits in the taliban after its founder mullah omar's death emerged in july. A number of senior taliban commanders refused to pledge allegiance to him and a faction opposed to him was set up last month under mullah mohammad rasool. Read more. The taliban source said the firing seemed to be spontaneous rather than planned. Several other taliban sources told the bbc that mullah mansour and his bodyguards had been at the house of another militant, abdullah sarhadi, when fighting broke out. Sarhadi is a taliban figure with symbolic importance after spending years in us detention in guantanamo bay, reports the bbc's dawood azami. Compared to mullah omar, his secretive predecessor, mullah mansour has adopted an open approach and has met taliban commanders regularly to discuss their policy concerns, our correspondent says. What prompted the shooting in quetta is unclear. \"during the discussion, some senior people developed differences and they opened fire at each other,\" said a senior taliban commander, reuters reports. Taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid categorically rejected the reports. \"no such incident has happened, because he is in afghanistan not in the area of pakistan  they have mentioned. Secondly his security is not weak to allow such an incident,\" he told the bbc afghan service. Mullah omar died in 2013 but his death was only confirmed in july. News of his death disrupted fledgling peace talks between the afghan government and the taliban. Some senior taliban leaders had been suspicious of mullah mansour's support for peace talks hosted by neighbouring pakistan, and accused pro-pakistani circles of installing him as the new leader. Since august mullah mansour has overseen a series of battlefield victories, including briefly capturing the northern afghan city of kunduz - a huge setback for western-backed afghan forces. But the islamist movement has split into openly warring factions since mullah omar died. Recent reports suggest one of the leaders of the breakaway taliban faction, mullah dadullah, was killed in recent fighting with militants loyal to mullah mansour."

Arriva trains wales, whose wales and borders franchise expires in 2018, is adding morning weekday services into cardiff central from barry and radyr. Economy minister ken skates had said arriva's profits were \"too high.\" The wales and borders franchise - which is one of the uk's most heavily subsidised, receiving between \u00e2\u00a3110m-\u00e2\u00a3160m a year - has seen passenger numbers rise from 18 million in 2003 to 30 million. About 265,000 people use cardiff central station weekly and a bbc investigation found overcrowding in cardiff stations during the morning commute was rising at a faster rate than anywhere else outside london, according to figures from the department for transport. Arriva trains wales now plans to add extra capacity and extra trains from 22 may on the following routes. Arriva trains wales said the additional trains were \"subject to railway approval processes\" but the announcement is \"one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade\". It said to implement the changes, the operator \"needed to remove one midday penarth service and one midday barry service\". The firm has a zero growth contract - which means it has the same number of trains it had when it began operations in 2003. It said the additions \"would not have been possible\" without network rail's recent \u00e2\u00a3300m signalling upgrade works and new platform eight at cardiff central. \"this is one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade, since the opening of the ebbw vale line,\" said arriva trains wales customer services director, lynne milligan. \"with only a limited number of trains in our fleet and the lack of availability in the uk we have had to work hard to get the most from what we've got.\" Network rail wales said \"more trains are travelling through cardiff than ever before\"."

Johnston's goal put kilcoo 1-6 to 0-6 up early in the second half and was always likely to prove decisive in such a low-scoring contest. Kilcoo's lead was cut to a point but the down champions moved three ahead again and then held on. Scotstown duo francis caulfield and sub brian mcginnity were sent off late on. Caulfield was dismissed after getting a second yellow card while mcginnity saw red after appearing to strike impressive kilcoo full-back darragh o'hanlon. The monaghan champions, beaten by crossmaglen after extra-time in last year's provincial final, only had points from darren hughes and donal morgan to show for their early domination as several other good chances were missed. Kilcoo hit back with five unanswered points after aaron branigan opened up their account in the ninth minute. Conor laverty's typically busy display was crucial to kilcoo's improvement as donal kane, paul devlin (two) and martin devlin also notched points. After being held scoreless for almost 20 minutes, scotstown found their range again late in the first half as the lively shane carey pointed a free and keeper rory beggan also hit the target from a 45 after missing three earlier long-range efforts. Aidan branigan's departure at half-time looked a blow for kilcoo but instead his replacement johnston went on to become the central personality in the match. The sides were level at 0-6 a piece when johnston held his nerve to produce a great finish past beggan after laverty had flicked on a long ball. After shane carey's reply, johnston looked to have palmed in a second kilcoo goal but the effort was ruled out - harshly it appeared - for a square ball. The controversial decision looked as though it could be match-turning as another carey point cut kilcoo's lead to the minimum but crucially beggan and carey then missed chances to get scotstown on terms. Paul devlin's superb long-range point and an aaron morgan score, after more great work by laverty, left kilcoo three ahead with three minutes of normal time left and carey's seventh point was all scotstown could summon in the remaining eight minutes of action. In addition to johnston and laverty, niall branigan and darragh o'hanlon were among kilcoo's stars as they set up a meeting either kilcar or glenswilly on 30 october."

The ex-pupils were caught up in a violent dispute outside holy cross primary school in 2001, which made headlines around the world at the time. The department of justice confirmed the payments after a freedom of information request from the belfast telegraph. The doj has received eight claims so far, three of which have been settled. The payments were made under the terms of the northern ireland criminal injuries compensation scheme 2002. However, the department would not disclose how much money has been paid out to the former holy cross pupils, in order to protect their identities. It told the newspaper this level of detail was \"exempt from disclosure\" under the freedom of information act and would \"contravene the first principle of the data protection act\". The school was thrust into the international spotlight at the start of term in september 2001, when hundreds of loyalist protesters tried to block the main route taken by the children and their parents on their walk to class. The three-month protest was sparked by a local dispute between catholic and protestant residents in ardoyne, north belfast. The protestants claimed that catholics were attacking their homes and said the school protest was their way of highlighting their concerns. However, stones, bottles, fireworks and even a blast bomb were used during weeks of unrest. Following the initial violence, the police and army put up crash barriers to keep a corridor route open for the holy cross pupils. Armed police officers escorted the children to class until the dispute was resolved. Ardoyne's parish priest at the time, fr aidan troy, told the belfast telegraph he could \"fully understand why people who have been through trauma would want to apply for compensation\". \"these were girls aged between four and 11, they were very young and very impressionable and were deeply affected by it. Every one of us were,\" he said. The priest added that while he would not \"go down the route of compensation myself\" he could \"well imagine the impact would be very great on children at such a formative age\". \"you could see their trauma,\" said fr troy. About 100 pupils needed counselling due to their daily ordeal, according to principal at the time, anne tanney. Speaking to the bbc in 2004, she said that even as an adult, she was traumatised by the protests. \"there were times when i couldn't eat, couldn't sleep,\" she said. \"i used to bite my lip, trying not to cry in front of the children.\""

These stunning pictures show the finer details of a butterfly's wing in stunning clarity, including their rainbow scales. As well as the beautiful colours, they show the layout of individual scales, which give the insect its iridescence. This image shows the wing of a sunset moth. The photos were shot by linden gledhill from staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry. The 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects' scale - covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their greek order name of lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye - catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail. The tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the eastern tiger swallowtail ( stock image ).

      "Article": "A g4s security van has been robbed outside a branch of royal bank of scotland in glasgow city centre. Police said three armed men took a five-figure sum from the vehicle in the city's sauchiehall street on monday at about 21:45. A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken. The area around the bank, which is near the buchanan galleries shopping centre, has been cordoned off by police. Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men, who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money. It is understood the cash taken was in the region of \u00e2\u00a350,000. Following the robbery, the three men got into a white seat leon car, which sped off along west nile street towards the cowcaddens area. The car has since been found in scott street, near stow college. Police said it was being taken for forensic examination. Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on west nile street, causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision, immediately prior to the robbery. Officers are appealing for the cyclist to contact them. The suspects are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing and balaclavas to conceal their identities. Det insp alasdair barlow said: \"we are reviewing cctv images in and around the city centre. \"we would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or noticed the car, in particular the cyclist. \"as the car left the scene, it was being driven at speed so people may have noticed its excessive speed.\""

This is a factual consistency issue as it misrepresents the location of the incident.\nSeverity: 5\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"bank\"\nExplanation: While not entirely incorrect, the article specifies that the robbery occurred outside a Royal Bank of Scotland branch, targeting a G4S security van, not the bank itself. The summary's phrasing might imply the bank was directly robbed, which slightly deviates from the article's details.\nSeverity: 2\n\nOverall score: Poor\nExplanation of the score: The overall score is 'Poor' due to the presence of significant factual inconsistency regarding the location (Error 1, Severity 5), which drastically alters the context of the event.

      "Article": "Petrol and diesel prices rose sharply in october, said the rac, taking them to their highest level since july 2015. The rac said the higher prices were due to a combination of rising crude oil prices, and the devaluation of the pound after june's brexit vote. Average petrol prices rose by 4.4p to 116.7p per litre and average diesel prices rose 5.2p to 118.7p per litre. The motoring body said these were the biggest monthly increases for three and a half years. Its fuel spokesman, simon williams, said retailers had \"no choice\" but to put up prices on garage forecourts. \"the effects of the weak pound have really been felt on the wholesale market, and this, combined with an oil price at nearly double its lowest level in 2016, has put significant upward pressure on wholesale fuel prices,\" he said. \"certainly, we are a long way from the remarkably low fuel prices enjoyed by families and businesses early in 2016, when the average price of unleaded was around 102p per litre and diesel was 101p,\" he added. According to the rac, the increases mean it now costs \u00e2\u00a364.20 to fill the 55-litre petrol tank of a typical family car. Meanwhile it costs \u00e2\u00a365.25 to fill up a similarly sized tank in a diesel car. The rac suggested that the price of fuel might stabilise in the coming months. \"opec, which represents some of the world's biggest oil producers, recently agreed in principle a cut in production,\" said mr williams. \"but a final deal is still to be agreed at an opec meeting at the end of this month and, with some analysts suggesting a deal might yet stall, this leaves open the prospect oil prices might stabilise or even fall before the end of the year,\" he added."

One error (Error 1) directly misrepresents the price increase for petrol, and the other (Error 2) introduces vagueness regarding the time frame.

Nhs managers have proposed a temporary downgrade of the hospital's maternity and paediatric services to cope with staffing shortages. The board of east sussex healthcare nhs trust will make a decision on friday. One paediatric nurse, who asked not to be named, said staff were devastated for their patients. She said: \"it's going to mean that many more children will have to make journeys across to hastings at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. \"they're sick. Their families are vulnerable. And i think it's going to have massive implications for children who are sick and for children who are long-term disabled.\" The nhs trust said the changes were being brought in for safety reasons because it was unable to recruit suitable specialist doctors which had led to an over-reliance on temporary and agency staff. Several options are being considered, but the trust has said its preferred plan is to have consultant-led obstetric services, neonatal services including the special care baby unit, in-patient paediatric services and emergency gynaecology services at the conquest hospital in hastings. Eastbourne hospital would have a stand-alone midwifery-led maternity unit and enhanced paediatric care. Paediatrician dr david scott said: \"they [patients] will get a better service if they go to hastings because they will get staff who will be better trained. \"there will be greater consultant availability so they will see more senior better trained staff. It will also allow us to increase the levels of nursing care available on the ward.\" Liz walke, from the campaign group save the dgh, which opposes the changes at eastbourne, said: \"we would like an independent body coming in and looking at the whole organisation to see if they can do something better and actually reorganise the services so that both hospitals keep their core services.\""

Historians and scientists are divided, but some experts believe the isolated area may have been built to attract people instead imprisoning them, and suggest it was a summer palace, monastery, or an astronomical observatory. The mysterious island, por - bajin, was found in the centre of a remote lake high in the mountains of southern siberia. A reconstruction sought to show what the island could have looked like before it was ruined. The fortress is located about 3, 800 km from moscow near the mongolian border.

He was treated at the scene by paramedics and did not need to go to hospital. Mr hill added: \"although thankfully, no-one involved in this incident was seriously injured, this was a terrifying ordeal for the men involved.

Judge deborah taylor qc ordered that brown should be detained indefinitely. She added he would only be released on the order of a judge or the government. Brown, of brockley rise, south-east london, appeared via video link from broadmoor hospital during the hearing. A jury found brown not guilty following a two-day trial at southwark crown court. He was also found not guilty, by reason of insanity, of possession of an offensive weapon and of assault by beating of mr ali. The trial heard brown had been delusional in his belief he would \"save humanity\" and exorcise a muslim demon haunting him by stabbing his victim. The court was told he was heard by other passengers to say \"where are all the muslims? I am going to kill all the muslims\", before holding a knife to the throat of another woman, who was unhurt. Brown accepted carrying out the attack but pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. Mr ali had been travelling home with his wife when the assault took place between honor oak park and forest hill, south london. He told court that the attack had left him too frightened to leave his house. \"i struggle to sleep at the time because every time i shut my eyes i have flashbacks to the whole thing\", he said. \"i can only assume it was me because my wife was wearing a headscarf.\" Detaining brown indefinitely under section 37 of the mental health act, judge taylor said: \"you have a long history of psychotic illness and on that day you were suffering and you continue to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. \"there's no doubt that if it had not been for the prompt intervention of an off-duty police officer and two medical practitioners that he he may well have died such were the severity of his injuries and the loss of blood.\""

The fund will offer grants for individuals to acquire specialised skills or further training. Ms sturgeon was meeting industry leaders and attending an energy jobs task force in aberdeen. She said: \"it is absolutely crucial that we take every possible action to retain the expertise that the industry has built up over decades so that it remains flexible enough to capitalise on exploration investment and future oil price rises.\" Also announced was \u00a312.5m of scottish enterprise funding aimed at helping oil and gas firms sustain growth and compete internationally by developing new innovative technologies. The announcements - and plans for a \u00a320m aberdeen international airport revamp - came just days after a \u00a3504m package was announced earlier by the uk and scottish governments to improve infrastructure in aberdeen and aberdeenshire, and to attract new jobs. North east scotland labour msp lewis macdonald said: \"the scottish government's offer of extra money to train those made redundant by the oil and gas industry is a step in the right direction but a year later than it should have been. \"this is the kind of initiative which should have been put in place when the north sea saw the first signs of a crisis, not after an estimated 65,000 people have already lost their jobs.\" North east scotland lib dem msp alison mcinnes said: \"this is welcome support for the tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs because of the downturn in the oil and gas industry. \"they are incredibly skilled staff whose experience cannot be wasted and who need to know the opportunities and help they need to retrain is available. \"what we now need to know is how exactly this fund will be distributed, who can apply and clear details as they come in of how many people are actually benefiting.\" The cost of a barrel of brent crude oil has decreased from more than $100 in january 2014 to less than $30 in january of this year.

A tearful williams called the statement \"unexpected\" and \"beautiful\". Now 52, she has forged a career as an actress, with major roles in ugly betty and desperate housewives. She also scored a global hit in 1992 with the ballad save the best for last; and her recording of colors of the wind from disney's pocahontas soundtrack earned her a golden globe, a grammy and an oscar for best original song. The new yorker won miss america in september 1983 but, months later, the pageant's executive committee voted unanimously to request that she resign after penthouse magazine published naked photographs she had posed for several years earlier,. Williams remains the only title-holder who was asked to resign in the pageant's history. She was invited back to the competition this year by chairman sam haskell, who asked her to serve as head judge. Before the competition started, he invited her on stage to receive the apology. \"i have been a close friend to this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years,\" he told the audience. \"you have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984 when you resigned. \"though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, i want to apologize to you and to your mother, miss helen williams.\" He continued: \"i want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less than the miss america you are and the miss america you always will be.\" The audience gave williams a standing ovation and tv coverage showed her mother on the verge of tears. \"thank you so much, sam, so unexpected but so beautiful,\" said the actress. \"i did the best that i could as miss america in 1983 to 84,\" she said. \"on behalf of my family, my mother in particular; [publicist] brian edwards, who orchestrated this entire thing to bring me back; and your leadership, your integrity and you bringing this pageant back to what it ought to be.

This is a factual consistency issue because it misattributes the event to the wrong person.\nSeverity: 5\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"who was asked to resign as Miss America in 1984\"\nExplanation: The article states that Vanessa Williams resigned after the pageant's executive committee voted unanimously to request her resignation, but it does not explicitly state she was \"asked to resign\" in the traditional sense. However, this is a minor issue compared to Error 1. The more significant factual inconsistency is with the subject (Helen vs. Vanessa).

Mr kalashnikov had been involved in the \"anti-maidan\" protests in support of deposed president viktor yanukovych. It is not clear if he was murdered or committed suicide. Police say an investigation has been launched. At least eight yanukovych allies have died suddenly in the last three months. Most of the deaths are said to have been suicides. However, officials say it was possible some were killed or forced to take their lives. Commentators in ukraine have accused supporters, as well as opponents, of the current pro-western government of involvement in the deaths. The bbc's david stern in kiev says no motive has emerged linking the deaths and no arrests have been made. Mr kalashnikov was a former deputy in parliament and a member of mr yanukovych's party of regions. Accounts of his death differ, with some sources saying his body was found outside his flat in kiev and others saying it was found within. Mr yanukovych fled ukraine in february last year, after months of increasingly violent protests against him, centred on the maidan, kiev's main square. He later reappeared in russia. The government that succeeded him reversed his opposition to closer ties with the european union - a major factor behind the protests.

Jon schueler, who died in new york in 1992 at the age of 75, created many of his pieces from a studio in mallaig in the highlands. He was inspired by views of the sound of sleat and also of skye, which lies across the stretch of sea. An arts symposium and exhibition at the college runs from friday to sunday. Called an linne: echoes, reflections and transfigurations, the events mark the centenary of the artist's birth in milwaukee, wisconsin, in 1916. The painter, who served as a navigator on us bombers flown out of england during world war two, moved to mallaig in 1957 and he continued to visit and work in the village in the north-west highlands throughout his career. Many of his pieces were influenced by the changing weather on the west coast and the effect the conditions had on the sea. Magda salvesen, curator of the jon schueler estate, said: \"the sound of sleat became to schueler a place of experience, memory and mood. \"the specificity of this body of water fed schueler's paintings - their imagery enlarged through layers of memory. \"how appropriate and challenging that the symposium celebrating the artist's centenary should be held on skye, an island seen through changing weather from his studio in mallaig.\" The celebration at smo - scotland's national centre for gaelic language and culture, and which offers a jon schueler residency scholarship - includes talks on schueler's life and work and an exhibition of selected pieces from his time in mallaig. Donnie munro, director of development, fundraising and the arts at smo, described the artist as having a \"profoundly deep experiential affinity with the sound of sleat\".

The attacker made the devices print a warning urging their owners to cut off remote access. Large printers in offices, domestic devices and tiny receipt printers in restaurants were all caught up in the hack. The attack came soon after a german academic study found vulnerabilities in a wide range of printers. Over the weekend, a hacker using the alias stackoverflowin ran an automated program that scoured the internet for printers that did not have basic security controls switched on. Once it discovered a vulnerable device, the program made them print a page announcing the invasion and telling the owner to close the \"port\" used to hijack it. \"for the love of god, please close this port, skid [script kiddie, ie novice coder],\" said the message. Early versions of the program also added ascii art depicting different robots or a computer. Also included were an email address and a twitter handle for stackoverflowin. Many people posted pictures of the printed messages to social media and asked questions about what was happening on technical support forums and social networks such as reddit. Printers made by hp, brother, epson, canon, lexmark, minolta and many others were hit by stackoverflowin's program. The hacker said he did not intend to abuse the access he had gained to the printers. \"i'm about helping people to fix their problem, but having a bit of fun at the same time,\" he told the bleeping computer tech news website. \"everyone's been cool about it and thanked me to be honest.\" Last week, computer security researchers jens muller, vladislav mladenov and juraj somorovsky, from the ruhr university, in germany, released an academic paper summarising work they had done on printer security. The trio tested 20 separate printers and found that all of them were vulnerable to at least one type of attack.

I will keep on achieving and i know you will keep on hating. Damn, but who cares.\" It was for such provocative views that ms baloch was loved, derided and mocked. She instigated a debate in pakistan on whether choosing to defy family and societal norms symbolised women's empowerment or was cheap narcissism. In death, too, what police suspect is an honour killing carried out by her brother reflects a deeply divided country. On social media, some believe her brother was justified in killing her. \"a girl who decides to publish her naked pics for sake of publicity.... what her brother is sppose (sic) to do?\" Asked one islamabad-based twitter user. It was down to an mp, nafisa shah, to sum up the argument for the other side, writing: \"a social media star who exposed social hypocrisy is murdered by a family vigilante created by a skewed law. Condemnable.\" But others are blaming the media too, for publicising her private and personal information such as her passport and national identity card. When a former husband revealed she also had a child after a supposed love marriage, she claimed that it was forced on her at the age of 17, and that he used to beat her. Ms baloch genuinely feared for her life, even before she wrote an unheeded letter to the interior ministry calling for protection. In an earlier interview with bbc urdu she said \"i am facing threats. But i believe that death is preordained - when you are meant to die, you will die.\" In life as well as death, qandeel baloch's story from her childhood in a small conservative town, to a video of her \"twerking\" and ultimately to her murder is perhaps all too pakistani in its contradictions and in its violence."

Thai officials said the event, which was halted minutes before it was due to start, could have affected relations between the two countries. The hrw report focuses on the treatment of a christian group in vietnam. The group said the thai response showed how freedom of speech had been eroded since the army seized power last year. Thai police said the event at the foreign correspondents club of thailand could \"have an impact on the country's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between thailand and vietnam\". It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month. The hrw report describes what it says is the persecution of montagnard christians in vietnam's central highlands. Their religious practices have been described by the vietnamese government as \"evil\". Sunai phasuk, human rights watch's senior researcher in asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was \"very disappointing\". \"thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [southeast asia], which adds more damage to thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule,\" he added. Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in may 2014."

      "Article": "Romanian prime minister sorin grindeanu has been forced from power after only six months by his own party, in a no-confidence vote in parliament. His left-wing social democrat party (psd) had accused him of failing to carry out necessary economic reforms. The prime minister was involved in a power struggle with party leader liviu dragnea, who was barred from office after a conviction for voter fraud. Mr grindeanu lost the censure motion by 241 votes to 10. The decision by his own party and its liberal alde allies to oust him was seen as a first, even for romania's turbulent politics. For the motion to pass they needed a parliamentary majority of 233 votes. The psd won elections in december only a year after losing power. Within weeks, protests erupted across the country over a decree seen as weakening anti-corruption measures in one of the european union's most corrupt member states. In february the eu warned the government in bucharest against \"backtracking\" in its efforts against corruption. Although mr grindeanu withdrew the decree, the crisis weakened the new government and soured relations between the prime minister and mr dragnea. Mr dragnea criticised his rival's performance in government on wednesday, accusing him of failing to push through \"the most ambitious programme since 1989\". Some commentators have argued that his removal was more about relaxing measures aimed at tackling corruption. Mr dragnea, while being the power behind the left-wing party's throne, cannot take power because he was given a suspended jail term for vote rigging and also faces trial for alleged abuse of office. His first choice as prime minister, sevil shhaideh, was turned down by president klaus iohannis in december. A new nominee from the ruling coalition will also have to be approved by the president. Far from being the sick man of europe, romania's economy is showing the highest growth in the eu, at 5.6% in the year to march 2017. However, its justice system has been under eu scrutiny ever since the country joined in 2007. In its most recent report this year, the eu's executive praised romania's anti-corruption agency (dna) but warned that the fight against corruption was under serious threat from political and media attack."

But the manchester derby this sunday still holds great significance for both clubs, managers and, of course, supporters. City have won the last four contests between the sides, as well as the previous three at old trafford. A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time. Here sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers. Can manuel pellegrini survive a derby loss? The word is the chilean's future will be decided come may when the dust on a creaking season has settled. Defeat to cross - town rivals would push chairman khaldoon al mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though. It would leave city trailing united by four points and likely to finish fourth, needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to champions league - - the very minimum requirement. Manuel pellegrini ( centre ) is a man under - pressure at city and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable. Who needs the win more? To that end you would probably have to say city. A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation, and reignite ambitions to finish second, possible saving pellegrini from the axe. United look set to finish in the top four regardless, the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory. But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours. United have never lost five in a row to city before. Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed. Glenn murray ( right ) tormented city at selhurst park as they dropped out of the premier league title race.

The organisation said that councils stood \"ready, willing and able to take at least 2,000 refugees\". All 32 local authorities have agreed to support a \"coordinated response\" to the humanitarian crisis. But not all council areas may end up receiving refugees due to the complex needs of those arriving. At least 18 local authorities could see the first groups of people arriving before christmas, cosla said. The unhcr estimates that 520,000 asylum seekers have arrived in europe by sea so far this year, most braving dangerous journeys from north africa and turkey as they flee the conflict in syria. The scottish government has pledged to accept at least 2,000 of the 20,000 refugees which the uk government has agreed to take. Cosla president david o'neill said there had been an \"unprecedented response\" from scottish local government to the crisis. He added: \"a number of councils had already been in discussions with the home office about their involvement in the syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme. \"the last three weeks has seen all scotland's councils willing to support a coordinated response to what can only be described as a humanitarian crisis. \"for many councils that has seen them committing to taking refugees immediately.\" Glasgow city council was one of a small number of councils across the uk that had already taken in syrian refugees, with more than a quarter of refugees that have arrived in the uk through the scheme being housed there. Cosla said scotland's local authorities had an excellent track record in supporting the most vulnerable in society and already had effective systems and partnerships in place which makes them well placed to host syrian refugees in their communities. But it said it recognised the scale of the task and the need for detailed planning. Cosla spokesman harry mcguigan said: \"we fully recognise that this is not simply about matching people to houses, and that we must meet the wider needs of people so that they can integrate into our communities and build a safe life in scotland. \"the response to this crisis will therefore be focused on balancing the urgency of the situation with planning the most appropriate ways in which councils and their community planning partners receive and integrate these extremely vulnerable people.\" Cosla called on the home office and the scottish government to ensure the programme is fully resourced so that local authorities and partners in areas such as health, the police and the voluntary sector could put appropriate services in place to meet the needs of refugees."

On monday, the bbc's panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage. The mannin branch of the celtic league has called on the manx government to campaign for a full, independent inspection of the plant in cumbria. Sellafield says the site is safe and has been improved with significant investment in recent years. A spokesman added: \"safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.\" The isle of man is located about 34 miles (55km) from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. Due to its potential impact on the manx fishing industry, the manx government began monitoring radioactivity levels in the irish sea in 1989. A government spokesman said: \"seafood fished in manx waters can contain traces of radio-nuclides associated with effluent discharges from sellafield to the irish sea, therefore these are monitored regularly to confirm that they remain well below maximum safe limits.\" The bbc investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant. He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants. The manx government said it was particularly concerned about \"the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos\". A spokesman added: \"however we are content that sellafield ltd and the nuclear regulators are trying to improve the safety situation. \"the government has asked questions about the technical solutions being developed to decommission these redundant structures and representatives have visited the site to look at the work under way\"."

Rather than having links to radical islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say. The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury. He has been  identified only as sergej w, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack. Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus. Spanish footballer marc bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack on 11 april, borussia dortmund's home champions league match against monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack. However, the following week, investigators cast \"significant doubt\" on jihadist motivations being behind it. They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed. Sergej w, 28, would have made about \u20ac3.9m euros ($4.2m; \u00a33.2m) from his actions, germany's bild newspaper reported. In a statement on friday (in german), the german federal prosecutor's office said he has german and russian nationality. He was arrested on friday near tubingen in rottenburg, south-west germany. The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on borussia dortmund shares - reportedly priced at \u20ac78,000 (\u00a365,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack. He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed. Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly. He was staying at the team's l'arriv\u00e9e hotel in dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say. The suspect placed the bet on 11 april using an ip address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money. Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed. The bus was damaged about six miles from the westfalenstadion - officially called signal iduna park - in dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off. Pictures from the scene showed its windows broken and its tyres burst."

      "Article": "Rail ticket machines cause so much confusion that one-fifth of passengers who use them buy the wrong ticket, according to the rail regulator. While 7% of people underpay and could be fined, 13% are paying too much. The office of rail and road (orr) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey. Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements. They say plans to simplify fares will help them to give clearer information on ticket machines. The orr employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines. \"despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines, our new research shows passengers may be paying more for their journey than necessary,\" said john larkinson, orr director of railway markets and economics. \"we are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey,\" he added. Rail operators c2c and scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay. Earlier this month, the rail delivery group (rdg), which represents train operators, announced a trial scheme to simplify fares. It said the 16 million fares on offer were \"baffling\" for passengers. As part of the trial, which begins in may, ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"to quickly benefit passengers, the rail delivery group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term,\" said mr larkinson. Paul plummer, chief executive of the rdg, told the bbc that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines, and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them. Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as \"queue-busters\" for passengers with relatively simple requirements, but \"expectations [of passengers] had evolved\". He said that the system of fares was far too complicated. The rdg also added: \"complex, decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right, simple options on ticket machines. \"simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices,\" they added. By ben morris, business reporter. In the british rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (tocs). The tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket."

The panel consists of leading educationalist prof sir robert salisbury, trade unionist john corey and belfast metropolitan college's principal marie-th\u00e3\u00a9r\u00e3\u00a8se mcgivern. Education minister john o'dowd has said he wants them to complete the investigation by early summer. The secondary school, in the andersonstown area of west belfast, has 1,100 pupils. About a third of its 70-strong teaching staff were absent for a period prior to easter, and, in an unusual move last month, an associate principal was appointed to the school. A group representing some parents also held a number of protests to express their concern about how the disputes were affecting their children. Mr o'dowd said that he wanted the panel to investigate events in the school, and make recommendations \"to ensure the school's future\". \"i consider the panel members to be eminently well qualified and experienced,\" he said. \"my priority continues to be to the pupils at the school and this investigation will give pupils, parents, staff and their representatives, and all those involved with the governance of the school, the opportunity to express their view.\" The investigation will look at staff relationships, the role of senior leadership, governance of the school and the impact of the ongoing disputes on pupils. Mr corey was general secretary of northern ireland public service alliance (nipsa) union from 2003-10 and is currently a member of the northern ireland human rights commission. Prior to her role at belfast metropolitan college, ms mcgivern was director of development at belfast city council. Sir robert, meanwhile, recently chaired the literacy and numeracy task force in northern ireland and is a former professor of education at the university of nottingham. The national association of schoolmasters and union of women teachers (nasuwt), which represents almost half the teachers at de la salle college, welcomed the appointments. It said the move \"should reassure all partners in the de la salle community that minister o'dowd is committed to finding a robust resolution to the recent period of challenge\". However, it said the terms of reference would be \"critical to the success or otherwise of the investigation\". The nasuwt also said it will \"seek assurances from the panel that their work will not cause any further disruption\". Jim clarke, chief executive of the council for catholic maintained schools (ccms), also welcomed the appointment of the panel. \"the background and experience of those who will be carrying out the investigation gives confidence to the process,\" he said. \"ccms will continue with its ongoing work with the other interests through the agreed strategy.

      "Article": "An indian woman who alleges she was forced to marry a pakistani man at gunpoint has returned to india, a day after a court in islamabad granted her request to leave. The woman, named only as uzma, was escorted across the wagah border by indian high commission officials. She has accused her husband, tahir ali, of torturing her. He denies the allegations. The incident comes amid increasing tension between india and pakistan. On thursday, india's foreign minister sushma swaraj tweeted, welcoming her return:. Pakistani security officials escorted uzma, who is in her early 20s, to the border crossing in the morning. She arrived in delhi later in the day. Uzma's return comes as india and pakistan trade accusations over violence in disputed kashmir, territory which both countries claim. Tensions also rose after pakistan sentenced an indian national, kulbhushan jadhav, to death on charges of spying. On her arrival in delhi, uzma described pakistan as \"a death trap\". \"i've seen women who go there after arranged marriages. They're miserable and living in terrible circumstances. There're two, three, even four wives in every house,\" she told a press conference. \"if i'd remained there for a few days more, i would have died.\" Uzma met tahir ali in malaysia and fell in love with him, according to reports. She then travelled to pakistan earlier this month where, she said, she was forced into marriage on 3 may. While there is enough evidence to suggest that uzma came to pakistan of her own accord, it remains unclear why she changed her mind. Tahir ali has said that his father sponsored uzma's visa for pakistan after the couple met in malaysia and decided to get married. Uzma's contention that she was married at \"gunpoint\" sits uneasily against the fact that she, along with mr ali and his relatives, had visited a district court in buner town to get married. The official who performed the wedding says she appeared to participate willingly in the ceremony. Mr ali has alleged that indian officials at the high commission forced her to change her mind. On 12 may, uzma filed an appeal in the islamabad high court, accusing her husband of harassing and intimidating her, and taking away her travel documents to stop her from leaving pakistan. She told the court that he had not told her that he was a married father of four and that she had been \"terribly beaten... tortured physically and mentally\". Uzma also has a five-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage. Her lawyer requested that the court should allow her to go back to india, saying her daughter was thalassaemic and needed daily blood transfusions. Mr ali told bbc's m ilyas khan in islamabad that the charges against him were false - he said she had known about his marital status and was \"disappointed\" that he was not allowed to speak to her under court's supervision. He said he was \"confident\" that she would get in touch with him once the dust had settled."

However, the primary concern here is factual consistency regarding the article's content. The article does specify the wedding date (April 11) and location (Dunblane Cathedral), which the summary does not. This omission isn't strictly an error in factual consistency but highlights incomplete information.

Emergency services were called to the scene at main road, where the a78 largs to seamill road was closed to traffic. The woman's 60-year-old husband and the lorry driver, 54, were rescued and taken to hospital with minor injuries. The building is split into five homes and the couple had been watching television in their bottom-floor flat. One other man who was in the building at the time was evacuated unhurt. Another resident callum calvey had been out at work when the lorry struck the building at about 13:45. \"my bathroom has been wiped out,\" said the 21-year-old tree surgeon, who lives directly upstairs from the the couple. \"there are five flats and none of the other residents are about, but i believe the couple's dog got out as well.\" Photographer arlene foster, who works for anna conway photography, was quickly at the scene from her local shop. \"the lorry is literally in someone's front room,\" she told bbc scotland. \"the lorry seems to have been going towards ardrossan but hit the building on the opposite side of the road. \"fortunately, it was quite quiet at the time - school kids could have been affected as well if it happened later.\" Police are urging drivers to stay away from the area, with southbound traffic being diverted at largs onto the a760 at hayley brae and northbound traffic being diverted at the hunterston roundabout. The local community had been pressing for a widening of the main road to hunterston power station and clyde port. Steve graham, chairman of fairlie community council, said: \"this was an accident waiting to happen. \"there have been a number of near misses, but nothing on this scale.

      "Article": "Some species of insects are at \"very low numbers\" in the uk after months of wet and cool weather, experts say. The buglife conservation charity says the recent period of damp weather has seen the numbers of bees, wasps, moths and butterflies shrink in 2012. Its chief executive matt shardlow said that if the country keeps on having periods of damp weather, then it could prove dangerous for some rare species. \"they might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction,\" he said. This year saw the wettest april-june quarter on record and further heavy rain in july. Mr shardlow said the damp conditions have resulted in fewer aphids for wasps to feed on, which has reduced their numbers. It is likely to take two more years for their numbers to recover, he added. He also said the approximately 250 species of bees in the uk need high temperatures to gather nectar and pollen. \"we are seeing very low numbers of them now, as well as small bumble bees, which is a sign they haven't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on.\" Buglife says there is no specific data collated on various insect numbers, but that its volunteers and experts have been spotting numbers and will detect \"massive year-on-year variation\" which they have reported this year. However, some data is collated on butterfly numbers, and mr shardlow says that this year could see the lowest number of that insect ever recorded in the uk. Moths, too, are being seen in fewer numbers, he said. However, the wet weather has been good news for some insects, such as the crane fly, drone fly and mosquitoes as well as molluscs such as slugs and snails, which all thrive in the damp conditions. \"this means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year,\" mr shardlow said. \"we've had reports of large numbers of glow worms, for example, which feed on slugs and snails.\" But richard ridler, chairman of essex beekeepers' association, says this year's bad weather has not necessarily killed off bees, just stopped them from venturing out into fields and gardens. \"the problem was that we had an appalling start to the year, which meant the bees stayed at home. Instead of going out, they stayed in their hives and ate their honey. I've had 25% of the honey yield that i would have expected this year. \"so the public saw a lot less of them. I haven't had beekeepers telling me that they've lost more bees than usual. \"this has been the most unusual, bizarre beekeeping year because of the weather. Most beekeepers i've spoken to have written this year off as an interesting experience, and one they hope not to have again for a while.\""

Three ferries were operated by seafrance on the dover to calais route. The service was suspended in november. Conservative mp for dover and deal charlie elphicke said: \"it is a real concern for the... people in dover who have worked for seafrance and also their families. \"this is a difficult day and i think the heart of the whole community goes out to them. \"obviously it's a real blow, [if] seafrance isn't operating that means there's less ferry traffic.\" There were tears from seafrance workers who gathered outside the court in paris to hear the decision on the firm's future. Many were protesting over the handling of seafrance's fate, with one banner questioning why french president, nikolas sarkozy had not intervened to save the company. Flares were lit in protest at the company's liquidation. Eurotunnel has not ruled out a future bid for the cross-channel ferry firm, which employs nearly 1,000 people. Mr elphicke said of eurotunnel's proposals: \"many people will want to know that they weren't simply going to buy them [seafrance's ferries] in order to scrap them. \"we need to make sure they give a clear plan as to why they are interested in the ferry business and not simply going to take out capacity. \"everyone is working as hard as they can to ensure that their jobs will be safeguarded and working as hard as they can to ensure that those ships will be back on route with a new buyer and a new purchaser.\" A spokesman said eurotunnel would \"now be working to see what the fair value of the assets\" were before making any decision.

Pictured : an air ambulance at the scene yesterday. Friends today told of their shock at the incident, which occurred in the quiet village just before 5. 15 pm yesterday. Peter mead, the secretary of stowmarket meadlands recreation club which mr clements had been chairman of for around 30 years, said they grew up together. The 70 - year - old from cotton, suffolk, said :' i heard about it last night it was a complete shock. I have been told that he was riding a lawnmower and it went into the pond. I don't know much more about how it happened. ` but knowing the sort of person richard was i am not surprised. He was a very hands on guy and would do that kind of work. ` we used to play football together and we used to work together at imperial chemical industries ( ici ). I worked in the sales office he was a chemist and then a waste environmental manager before he retired about three of four years ago. ` he was just a really nice bloke. The club used to be part of ici but we wanted to make it independent and richard was heavily involved on that. ` he did so much for the club, he's really going to be missed. He'"

      "Article": "Thousands of jordanians have attended a protest demanding political reforms in amman, hours after king abdullah called early parliamentary elections. The muslim brotherhood's political wing, the islamic action front, called for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament. People at the protest chanted: \"the people want to reform the regime.\" On thursday evening, the king dissolved parliament and called early elections, though he did not specify a date. He has said he wants polls to be held by the end of the year. The iaf said it expected 50,000 people to take part in the protest outside the capital's al-husseini mosque after friday prayers. But the bbc's wyre davies put the turnout at 10,000 people, which he said was the biggest protest seen in jordan for several years. Video footage showed protesters chanting slogans and waving flags. The afp news agency quoted people as shouting: \"we demand constitutional reform before the people revolt. The people want to reform the regime.\" A counter-rally, in support of king abdullah, which organisers had predicted would attract 200,000 supporters, was cancelled late on thursday in order to prevent clashes between the two groups. Earlier, police said they had detained eight people travelling towards the rally and had seized three vehicles containing sticks, knives and guns. Friday's protest in the capital and the dissolution of parliament come amid mounting opposition anger at the electoral law passed in july by the government of the conservative prime minister fayez al-tarawneh. The electoral law increased the number of seats in the house of representatives from 120 to 150 seats and gave the electorate two votes - one for a district representative and one for national level lists that include political parties - replacing the single non-transferable vote. The iaf's leader, hamza mansour, dismissed the legislation as \"just a cosmetic change meant to buy time and insufficient for real reforms\". Opposition parties demanded that 50% of seats be allocated to party lists, but the new electoral law gave them just 27 seats, or 18%. They also complained that the new law would strengthen supporters of the king by allocating three more seats for women from bedouin districts. This, they argued, would continue to marginalise jordanians of palestinian origin - who make up 60% of the population but have little political power - in favour of those descended from jordan's original bedouin inhabitants - whose tribes dominate the government and security forces and are the bedrock of the hashemite monarchy. Traditionally, many of the iaf's supporters have been jordanians of palestinian origin. The opposition also demanded that parliament, rather than the king, should have the right to appoint and dismiss the prime minister. Despite the call for reforms, jordan has so far avoided the unrest and political upheaval that rocked much of the arab world last year. Protests have been relatively small and have not gained the same level of political momentum as those in tunisia, egypt, libya, yemen and syria. Correction 25 january 2013: a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that members of the jordanian security forces were allowed to vote for the first time."

Miss sturgeon struggled once again in a tv election clash screened by the bbc, just a day after she faced an audience backlash by refusing to rule out a snap second referendum on independence.

And wiretaps and other intelligence revealed that the group planned to carry out terrorist attacks in afghanistan and pakistan as well as in italy, according to caligari chief prosecutor mauro mura. Some evidence indicated the vatican was among the targets considered, police said. Talk of this took place march 2010, around the time a possible suicide bomber from afghanistan entered italy, mura said. Police said, too, that some of the suspects were involved in a pakistani market bombing in 2009 in which more than 300 people were killed and injured. The suspects had been under surveillance for years, some as far back as 2005, police said.

An early build of the new os, known as android n, was released on thursday for app developers to test. Google said it had released the beta software earlier than usual so that device manufacturers could get the finished version sooner. At the moment, fewer than 3% of android phones run the latest os, marshmallow. Typically, google discusses the next generation of its android os at its annual developer conference in the summer. But this year it has released a first draft earlier than expected. \"by releasing the first preview and asking for your feedback now (in march! ), we'll be able to act on that feedback while still being able to hand off the final n release to device makers this summer,\" wrote hiroshi lockheimer, senior vice president of android, in a blog post. On monday, google published statistics that showed an older version of android, lollipop, was still more widely used than the latest variant. About 36% of android devices run lollipop, with fewer than 3% running the newer marshmallow. But a range of new smartphones running marshmallow, from manufacturers such as samsung and lg, are due to be released. Android n will introduce split-screen multitasking that allows people to use two apps at the same time. Information can be copied across from one app to the other. A similar feature is already available on some ios and windows 10 devices, and samsung has already added the feature to some of its android smartphones. The new software also introduces some cosmetic changes to settings and notifications, and aims to improve battery life. Google has traditionally named new versions of the operating system after sweet treats, as was the case with lollipop and marshmallow. The newest version has not yet been named but it has been suggested that android n will be named after a popular chocolate and hazelnut breakfast spread. \"we're nut tellin' you yet,\" said mr lockheimer, possibly hinting at the name."

Vladmir lenin may have been dead for 90 years, but his corpse looks better than the day he passed. This is the claim made by his embalmers, who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary's body. Pictured is his body in 1997. The gruesome job is the responsibility of a team known as the `mausoleum group' which, at its peak, involved 200 scientists working in a lab dedicated to the former leader's corpse. According to a detailed report by jeremy hsu in scientific american, the russians prefer to preserve the body's shape, weight, colour and flexibility, rather than biological tissue. ` they have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials,' alexei yurchak, professor of social anthropology at the university of california, berkeley told mr hsu. ` that makes it dramatically different from everything in the past, such as mummification.' Yurchak has published a paper on this project in the journal representations, along with a book, `everything was forever, until it was no more : the last soviet generation.' The bolshevik leader's remains were embalmed on stalin's orders when he died aged 53 in 1924 and kept on display in moscow apart from a period in the second world war. The revolutionary's body is on public display in a mausoleum on moscow's red square more than two decades after the break - up of the former ussr.

However, according to the article, it is actually Vladimir Lenin's corpse that has been preserved using these methods, as initiated by Stalin's orders. This is a factual consistency issue because it misidentifies the subject of the preservation efforts.\nSeverity: 5\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"They prefer to preserve...\" (in the context of the summary)\nExplanation: While the statement itself is factually correct according to the article, its attribution in the summary is ambiguous due to Error 1. However, considering it standalone, there's another issue - the subject \"They\" refers to the embalmers, but this is not explicitly clear in the summary due to the lack of context or a direct connection to the embalmers mentioned earlier. The primary error here, though, relates more to contextual clarity than factual consistency with the article's content about Lenin. Given the strict instructions, we focus on direct factual inconsistencies, making this more of a secondary concern. Yet, for thoroughness: \nSeverity (if counted solely on minor factual ambiguity due to context loss): 2\n\nOverall score: Unacceptable\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains a severe factual inconsistency (Error 1) that fundamentally alters the subject of the preservation efforts, rendering the summary factually incorrect in a significant way.

      "Article": "The wife of a jailed drugs ring boss who dug up his \u00a3270,000 cash stockpile to help launder it has been jailed, along with her mother and sister. Domenico masciopinto, 35, was sentenced to 14 years in 2012 for drug-dealing. From prison he told his now estranged wife giulia masciopinto, 37, to unearth cash buried in their bedford garden. She has been jailed for nine months. Her mother caterina de filippo, 58, and sister palma de filippo, 28, were given 12-month sentences for helping her. Domenico masciopinto was sentenced to 22 months, after admitting concealing criminal property, to run consecutively to his 14-year term. His wife also pleaded guilty to the charge, but the de filippos, who she enlisted but who denied the accusations, were found guilty last month. Judge kristina montgomery qc, sitting at amersham law courts for aylesbury crown court, said the masciopintos would have been jailed for longer if they had not admitted the crime. Cash was found by police stuffed around the bedford homes of giulia masciopinto, in redhall close, and her mother's in harrowden road, in march 2013. Officers were alerted by masciopinto's recorded prison calls to his wife, as he feared the buried cash would perish as it was not in watertight containers. A holdall containing \u00a3237,000 was discovered, while thousands of pounds were also found in a handbag, plastic bag and foil-wrapped bundles. Other money had been paid into bank accounts. Palma de filippo, of high st, acton, west london, helped by hiding some of the cash in her car boot and laundering it. Det insp pushpa guild, of bedfordshire police, called it a \"sophisticated attempt\" to hide criminal proceeds. Police said some seized cash would go towards paying a \u00a3121,736 confiscation order, made after masciopinto was jailed three years ago. However, some notes were unusable as they had turned mouldy due to the way they were stashed."

Mr davis said he wanted to hold a monthly meeting to share analysis as part of a \"two-way information flow\" with each of the three nations. He believed that would allow the devolved administrations to voice their views as the westminster government prepares talks with brussels. Mr davis said: \"today's meeting was an important step in bringing the devolved administrations together with the uk government to discuss how we can work together to get the best deal for the whole of the uk. \"naturally, there are different standpoints around the table, but the meeting was constructive and amicable. We will meet regularly and share our latest thinking as the uk shapes its negotiating strategy. \"we will work positively with the scottish government, the welsh government and the northern ireland executive as we implement the decision of the people of the uk to leave the eu.\" Mr russell said it was \"good\" that the process of involving the scottish government was under way. But he added: \"more than four months after the referendum the uk government has still not made its strategic intentions clear. \"there was a discussion over eu market access but we do not know whether uk ministers want to remain inside the single market or the customs union. This will remain a considerable problem as we continue to promote the interests of scotland. \"the uk government must provide greater clarity and transparency on its intentions.\" He said he made it \"absolutely clear\" that membership of the single market \"is essential for the economic prosperity of scotland\".

Following his death, presidential elections were called for 14 april, pitting mr maduro against main opposition candidate henrique capriles. Mr capriles says that despite mr maduro's attempt at portraying himself as mr chavez's heir, the acting president lacks the late leader's charisma. \"i'm going to look after it for a few years, but it'll always be chavez's home,\" mr maduro said referring to the miraflores palace in caracas, where venezuela's presidents have their office. Full of confidence ahead of sunday's polls, mr maduro said he would \"occupy a small office in miraflores in another wing\", so that venezuelans could roam the rooms of the presidential palace and \"learn how the commander had lived, and what he had eaten\". Fierce battle. Since mr chavez died on 5 march, mr maduro has cast himself as his natural successor in office. He has called himself \"chavez's son\" and said that the late president had appeared to him in the form of a little bird.

Henrique capriles mocked mr maduro saying that he had \"not seen a little bird, but swallowed one, the one he has in his head!\" He has also questioned mr maduro's ability to lead the country saying that \"whatever the outcome, i don't see how nicolas maduro has the capacity to stay for an extended time in government\".

The 24-hour industrial action is part of an ongoing dispute over staffing and the role of conductors. A strike planned for 4 april on southern routes was moved to 8 april after the company offered fresh talks. Merseyrail said coinciding a strike with the race meeting would damage liverpool's reputation. Speaking after its failed talks with the union on monday, merseyrail's managing director jan chaudhry-van der velde said the strikes would \"do immeasurable damage\" as the \"eyes of the world will be on liverpool\" during the grand national. Rmt general secretary mick cash said the \"cynical and hostile stance from merseyrail\" left the union \"with no option but to put on this additional strike action\". He said the rmt \"recognises the severe impact that the action will have\" but asked the public \"to understand that we have no option but to take this high-profile action to force the company back to the negotiating table\". Mr chaudhry-van der velde said the rmt \"has sunk to a new low\" by inflicting \"a barefaced attack on the reputation of our region\" on \"one of its proudest and most important days of the year\". Merseyrail has \"a range of contingency plans\" which would \"almost inevitably involve using buses to replace trains\", he said. Mr cash called on southern to \"get out of the bunker and to start making some progress\". He said rmt members on southern \"have shown incredible strength and resilience throughout the past year\" and \"have been clear from the off that this is not a dispute about who opens the doors\". \"it is a dispute about a safe method of operation and about the guarantee of that crucial, second safety-critical member of staff,\" he said. A southern spokesman said: \"we have received no official confirmation from the rmt and will review our response when we do.\" Richard allan, deputy managing director of arriva rail north, said he was \"surprised\" at the move as \"we had been in contact with their officials in the last 24 hours to organise further talks\". David sidebottom, director of independent watchdog transport focus, said: \"yet more strikes are being dumped on passengers who may have to cancel plans or endure miserable journeys. \"it is vital that all parties in this dispute get back around the table to resolve this matter without bringing the railway to a standstill.\" Up to 2,000 staff at southern rail, merseyrail and northern rail walked out on 13 march in the ongoing dispute but only limited disruption was reported."

The adapted artwork for the sgt pepper's lonely hearts club band album is worth about??70,000. It was created to celebrate the success of the record - released in june 1967 - for christmas of that year. The artwork is one of five beatles album sleeves to feature in the top 10, compiled by record collector magazine. Sir peter blake's original sgt pepper collage was doctored to replace the faces of the beatles and other notable figures with those of executives from the band's us label capitol. Only about 100 are thought to have been made. 'main attraction' in second place, valued at? ?7,000, are the first 10 numbered copies of the beatles' self-titled 1968 record, which became known as the white album because of its plain white cover. The band's name was embossed on the front of the sleeve, which was designed by pop artist richard hamilton, along with a unique stamped serial number. In third position was a pair of sleeves designed by andy warhol. Madrigals' 1953 work magic key to spanish volumes 1 and 2, and spoken word anti-crime lecture the nation's nightmare, from 1951, have been valued at? ?3,500 and? ?3,000 respectively. At number four was the bizarre us-released compilation album jolly what! England's greatest recording stars: the beatles and frank ifield on stage. The 1964 album, featuring the songs of both the fab four and crooner ifield, is valued at??3,000. The beatles  were also in eighth place for the original album sleeve created for the us release of their yesterday and today record in 1966, which is valued at??2,000. Known as \"the butcher sleeve\" because it featured the musicians posing with dismembered doll parts and slabs of meat, it was quickly withdrawn from the us market. List compiler ian shirley, editor of the rare record price guide 2012, said: \"while pristine records and inserts are vital to securing a top price, the numbered sleeve is the main attraction. \"the hunger to collect low numbers remains undiminished amongst beatles fans.\""

It's the most popular board game in the world, with hundreds of versions springing up in far - flung cities across the globe. But monopoly - makers planning a special exeter edition have been told there is nowhere low - rent enough to fill the space of old kent road. Thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across the city in devon to fill the more expensive slots, which are taken up on the london version by the likes of mayfair and park lane. But no one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board, which cost $ 60 in monopoly money. High - end game zones have been easily filled with locations like the city's gothic cathedral, exeter castle, the guildhall and modern shopping centre. But exeter has outdone all previous cities to get their own board - including oxford, cambridge and york - in the posh stakes, with no suggestions for the lower end.

The firm, which controls two-fifths of the scotch whisky industry, reported scotch sales down 5% by volume. However, single malts from scotland continued their rise, led by the singleton in the us and taiwan. American whiskey sales were also strengthened by apple-flavoured bottlings. The london-based company has lost momentum due to slowing growth in key markets, including south america and china. It has had lower shipments, as wholesalers have pulled back on stock-holding. Despite flat comparable sales, diageo posted a rise in pre-tax profits - from \u00a32.7bn to \u00a32.9bn. A big increase in volume of sales was driven by the acquisition of united spirits in india, which boosted reported net sales by 5%. Currency movements had an impact on its results, most significantly the venezuelan bolivar and the russian ruble. That cut \u00a3370m from sales and \u00a3100m from operating profit, once translated into sterling. Some markets saw diageo facing tough price competition, including smirnoff vodka in the us and johnnie walker whisky in brazil. Notable improvements in sales were reported for johnnie walker in mexico, while guinness returned to growth in its uk and irish home market. American blonde lager drove guinness sales up in the us. Net sales were up 6% in africa. Other developments during the financial year included a buyout of the remaining half of the don julio tequila brand, the sale of gleneagles hotel and resort in perthshire, and a shifting of strategy in south africa to focus on spirits.

      "Article": "New guidance has been offered to landowners to help them avoid clashes with dog owners. Scottish natural heritage (snh), which has issued the advice, had previously heard complaints about \"significant problems\" with irresponsible owners. Farmers said some were unable to control their dogs around livestock and let the pets run through crops. The advice includes opening up less sensitive areas to dog walkers rather than trying to ban them completely. Drawing on the experiences of farmers and estate owners, the guidance also encourages landowners to explain why certain places should be avoided. The reasons include ground-nesting birds using the land and areas being used for rearing young lambs or calves. Nfu scotland, scottish land and estates, the kennel club and the scottish kennel club were consulted by snh. Bridget finton, snh recreation and access officer, said almost four million adults visited scotland's outdoors every year and about 48% of those people brought a dog with them. She said: \"these high numbers show how dog walking helps lots of people get healthy outdoor activity, but it's really important to minimise the number of occasions when dogs cause land managers' concerns. \"this guidance aims to influence the behaviour of the minority of dog walkers who act irresponsibly - actions that can have a big impact on livestock and wildlife, as well as those who are trying to enjoy the outdoors without getting dog dirt on their shoes.\" Gemma thomson, of nfus, said: \"nfus has been aware of increasing issues experienced by members as a result of dog access. \"there have been a number high profile instances which have occurred recently. \"nfus is pleased to support the guidance, which should go some way to helping some land managers in ensuring that they are clear about access rights, and also assist them in finding innovative ways to address issues where they occur.\" Anne gray, policy officer with scottish land and estates, said a variety of problems related to dog walking were reported to her every year. She said: \"these issues range from people not picking-up after their dog has gone to the toilet to dogs disturbing livestock, game birds or wildlife. \"we hope this guidance will give landowners, farmers and other land managers helpful tips on how to manage dog-walking on their land in a positive and effective way. \"we want everyone to have a good experience of being out and about in the countryside.\""

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under - fire manager manuel pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for manchester city this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester city striker sergio aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by united at old trafford. The afternoon started so well for aguero and city when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes. Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for manchester city with david silva as de gea looks dejected. It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at old trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant sergio aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice - cream but the argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where city would have been without that century. Remember that title - winning goal against qpr in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from mario balotelli. Not kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had city fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what city paid what now looks like a bargain $ 38m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for city in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration. The argentine strikes in injury time against qpr to win manchester city the title in 2012.

      "Article": "The two most notorious and violent street gangs in honduras have promised to end the violence which has claimed tens of thousands of lives. Mara salvatrucha and mara 18 street said they would commit to zero crime and zero violence on the streets. Honduras has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Although no formal peace deal has been signed, the apparent ceasefire is thought to be the first step towards a more lasting agreement. \"our truce is with god, with society and with the authorities,\" announced a spokesman for mara salvatrucha, identified only as marco. \"we ask society and the authorities to forgive us for the damage we have done,\" he said at a news conference inside a prison in the honduran city of san pedro sula. A leader of the rival 18 street gang - who did not want to be identified - offered the same promises, but only \"if the government will listen,\" he added. On monday, the honduran president porfirio lobo personally offered his support for the truce. \"we have to look for anything that's an alternative to violence,\" he told the associated press news agency. \"on the part of the government, we are open to any process that can lower violence.\" The roman catholic bishop romulo emiliani, who helped to broker the deal, said last week that the gangs needed government help to break away from their criminal activities, which included extorting money from businesses to finance their war. He said the authorities should try to turn honduras' prisons into rehabilitation centres. His comments were echoed by gang leader marco, who called on the government to support craft workshops so that they could work, earn a living and be reintegrated into society. \"i want my son to be a doctor or a cameraman, not a gangster,\" he said. The bbc central america correspondent will grant says this is a significant step towards a full peace accord. He adds that, in honduras, hopes remain high that this latest plan could help tackle gang crime in the country. The deal follows a similar pact reached more than a year ago in neighbouring el salvador. The peace agreement there has roughly held together and, the authorities say, has contributed to a significant reduction in the murder rate and incidences of other violent crimes. The salvadorian government says homicides have dropped about 52%. Mara salvatrucha and mara 18 street have their roots in the 1980s in southern california. They were created in los angeles and its suburbs by poor, mostly illegal, immigrants who had escaped civil wars in central america. When the conflicts ended there, many gang members were deported from the us, exporting la's gang culture with them."

Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at lancaster house on thursday. Mr cameron says corruption is \"the root of so many of the world's problems\". He also described it as \"an enemy of progress\". \"it destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,\" he added. \"the battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. \"for too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.\" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents ashraf ghani of afghanistan, juan manuel santos of colombia and muhammadu buhari of nigeria, and norwegian prime minister erna solberg.

      "Article": "The state has a responsibility to ensure that every child in scotland has access to food, according to the children's commissioner. Bruce adamson also called on ministers to gather accurate data on the number of children who go hungry because they do not have access to free meals during school holidays. About 255,230 pupils are registered for free school meals in scotland. The government said it was \"taking steps\" to measure food insecurity. Mr adamson paid tribute to charities such as the trussell trust, which has begun a pilot project in glasgow to offer cookery lessons to parents struggling to make ends meet during the holidays. He told the bbc's good morning scotland programme: \"there shouldn't be stigma attached to having basic rights to food. \"the obligation is on the state to make sure that every child in scotland is getting access to the food, the education, the healthcare, everything that they need. And that shouldn't be a problem in the holidays. \"the more support we can provide to the trussell trust and to all of the different programmes right across scotland at community level that are delivering these important rights for children, the better.\" He added: \"it is a particular challenge over the holidays, which should be a time of joy and excitement and fun, but actually it is the most challenging time of the year for many families in scotland facing poverty.\" The scottish government introduced free school meals for all children in primary 1-3 in 2015. Since then, more than 77% of the 173,000 five to seven-year-olds that are registered take up the option of a free meal at school. However, the numbers registered falls significantly for subsequent age groups, with only 39,215 registered in p4-7 and 38,841 secondary school pupils entitled to a free meal during term time. A scottish government spokeswoman said that no child should be going hungry and that tackling inequality was a key government priority. She added: \"local authorities have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs. \"in addition, we have already invested over \u00e2\u00a3350m in welfare mitigation measures, in addition to our \u00e2\u00a31m fair food fund, which supports projects that promote dignity and harness the social potential of food to connect people and develop sustainable solutions to food poverty.\" She acknowledged that more work was needed to measure the numbers of children thought to be going hungry. She said: \"the scottish government has therefore taken steps to better measure the full range of food insecurity in scotland. \"three questions on food insecurity in scotland will be included in the scottish health survey 2017. Thereafter, the full united nations food insecurity question set will be included in the shs from 2018 onwards. \"this will allow internationally comparable baseline data on food insecurity in scotland to be available in 2019 with further data sets available annually thereafter.\""

The celebration of food, music and culture will culminate again in a parade through chapeltown and harehills. An estimated 160,000 revellers attended last year's carnival, organisers said. Arthur france initiated it after becoming homesick for his native st kitts and nevis. Mr france, head of the organising committee, said: \"when you come to carnival it is electric, so many things going on, beautiful costumes, beautiful colours, beautiful music.\" However, attempts to bring the parade into the city centre have been shelved. Mr france said he was \"very sad and upset\" at the council decision but added that it would not \"dampen my spirits\". Councillor judith blake, leader of leeds city council, said: \"a lot of events are happening on the bank holiday weekend and with the advice it just wouldn't be possible.\" Ms blake added: \"the oldest carnival in europe is here in leeds.

The leinster back-rower has been out for a number of weeks with a calf injury but has taken a full part in training since tuesday.

Ian keatley is named as fly-half paddy jackson's understudy on the bench, which also includes winger tommy bowe. Media playback is not supported on this device. Ryan has been suffering from a niggling medial ligament injury and has not trained since tuesday. \"we wanted a bit more certainty about him but at the same time iain has done a super job for us in the past,\" explained ireland coach joe schmidt at the team announcement. Keith earls and simon zebo start on the wings. Regular number 10 johnny sexton was ruled out of the murrayfield match earlier this week as the calf injury he picked up in leinster's champions cup game against castres on 20 january has not yet fully healed. The 31-year-old has an \"outside chance\" of being fit to face italy in rome on 11 february, according to schmidt. Sexton's unavailability leaves ulster's jackson to make his sixth start in eight games for ireland, his last coming in the victory over australia in ireland's final autumn international in november. Munster flanker peter o'mahony is out with a hamstring problem so open-side o'brien joins blind-side flanker cj stander and number eight jamie heaslip in the back row. Andrew trimble's absence with a groin injury left earls and zebo as obvious choices to join full-back rob kearney in the back three, with bowe getting the nod among the replacements ahead of craig gilroy or tiernan o'halloran. Garry ringrose and robbie henshaw form the midfield pairing, with conor murray joining jackson to make up the half-back partnership. Up front, the front row combination of jack mcgrath, rory best and tadhg furlong is retained, while devin toner joins henderson at lock. Uncapped hooker niall scannell and his munster front-row partner john ryan are listed as replacements in preference to james tracy and finlay bealham. Bbc scotland's tom english.

The rumpus comes a month after liberal democrat councillor martin elengorn was caught playing scrabble during a richmond council budget meeting in south - west london.

The conservative minister said he was inviting other political parties for talks on securing \"the best possible devolution settlement for wales\". A new uk cabinet committee chaired by commons leader william hague will now meet for the first time on wednesday. Mr crabb's comments come as wales' first minister carwyn jones called for a convention on future of the uk. Speaking on tuesday at the labour party conference, mr jones said the union cannot be rebuilt through conversation between only westminster and scotland. Now the welsh secretary has pledged to keep wales at the discussion table on the future of devolved powers across britain. Mr crabb said he had already held preliminary discussions with mr hague, a former welsh secretary himself. \"we are both in absolute agreement that wales should be central to the debate that is now commencing,\" said mr crabb. \"i want us to use this opportunity positively to look again at how we secure the best possible devolution settlement for wales. \"i want to move forward in a realistic, open-minded and pragmatic way.\" Mr crabb has written to the leaders of other welsh parties at westminster inviting them to a wales office \"summit\" to discuss \"how we deliver devolution that works for wales\". The meeting is likely to take place when parliament returns next month. He said he is also arranging meetings with party leaders in the national assembly to ensure their views feed into the debate. The comments from mr crabb came as prime minister david cameron hosted discussions with backbench tory mps at his chequers country residence. One of the two welsh mps to attend was the aberconway mp, guto bebb. He said events in scotland have \"completely changed the nature of the debate\" on devolution. Key to monday's talks have been the issue of \"english votes for english laws\", which would see welsh and scottish mps excluded from voting on devolved matters in the house of commons. That has led to labour party leader ed miliband accusing mr cameron of planning to set the uk nations against each other. But the aberconway mp said he took a different view. \"the promises made to scotland must be delivered upon and if they are delivered on then we are going to end up in my view with english votes for english laws and that in my view is a simple matter of fairness,\" said mr bebb."

The article clearly states she was arrested after her husband's body was found, following a report of him missing.

      "Article": "Foreign airlines are halting flights to nigeria, where a foreign exchange crisis has led the government to limit access to dollars. Us carrier united airlines has said it will end daily flights between houston, texas and nigeria's commercial capital, lagos, on 30 june. It follows spanish airline iberia's decision to pull out in may. Falling oil prices have hurt africa's biggest economy, which has contracted for the first time since 2004. As a result of the foreign currency restrictions, airlines have been unable to repatriate up to $600m (\u00e2\u00a3417m) in ticket sales, according to the international air transport association (iata). Foreign currency reserves have dwindled to their lowest level in more than ten years and the government introduced a currency peg last year that has created a black market for the naira currency. \"the inability of airlines to access forex in africa's largest economy, if not solved, will affect air transport services to, from and within nigeria and undermine the country's position as west africa's aviation hub,\" iata said this week. Iberia said it was leaving nigeria due to \"very difficult operating circumstances and dwindling passenger numbers.\" Businesses operating in nigeria are struggling to get their hands on dollars, sterling or euros, says the bbc's west africa correspondent martin patience. The official exchange rate, which is controlled by the government is also very low compared to the black market rate. \"if you take $1, the official rate is 200 naira but if you then go on the black market where you will get the cash it can often cost you double that and airlines...simply can't go on the black market to get business done,\" says patience. Nigeria's economy contracted 0.4% in the first quarter of this year and last month nigeria's central bank governor said a recession appeared \"imminent.\" The central bank also announced plans to introduce a greater flexibility into the foreign exchange market."

According to the article, only two specific airlines (United Airlines and Iberia) have announced plans to halt or have halted flights. This generalization is a factual consistency issue.\nSeverity: 3\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"due to a lack of foreign currency\"\nExplanation: While the article mentions foreign currency restrictions as a reason for airlines' struggles, it specifically highlights the inability to repatriate ticket sales (up to $600m) and the difficulties in accessing forex at the official rate. Saying \"lack of foreign currency\" oversimplifies and slightly misrepresents the issue.\nSeverity: 2\n\nOverall score: Fair\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains two errors that affect its factual consistency with the article. Error 1 (severity 3) introduces an unwarranted generalization, and Error 2 (severity 2) simplifies the foreign currency issue. However, the summary still conveys a core challenge faced by airlines in Nigeria.

The rare tyrannosaurus bataar, 7m long (23ft), was bought by an anonymous bidder for more than $1m (\u00e2\u00a3630,000) in new york. The sale went ahead despite protests from the mongolian president. Elbegdorj tsakhia says the skeleton, unearthed in the gobi desert, came from mongolia and that exporting fossils found in the country is illegal. The auctioneers, heritage auctions, say the specimen was imported legally. A restraining court order in the name of the mongolian leader was put on the sale. Tyrannosaurus bataar is an asian cousin of the meat-eating tyrannosaurus rex. The skeleton in new york is thought to be one of the most complete and well preserved ever discovered, says the bbc's jonathan blake in washington. \"when it comes to dinosaurs, number one, dinosaurs in general are extremely rare. But the rarest of the dinosaurs are the carnivores, the meat eaters - the top of the food chain if you will,\" david herskowitz, director of natural history at heritage auctions, told aptv. \"and, of all the meat eaters that are out there, the most famous are the tyrannosaurids. They are the most desirable, but they are the most elusive. They are the most difficult to find. Even though they are so big, there are not that many of them around.\" Found about seven years ago in the gobi desert, the t. bataar remained in storage in england. The t. bataar was slightly smaller and had longer arms than its cousin, mr herskowitz said. This is the second tyrannosaurid to be sold at auction, says mr herskowitz. The first was a t. rex named sue sold in 1997 for more than $8m. Lawyers for the auction house say the sale did not break any us laws - but it will not be confirmed until it has been approved by a us court."

Mr maxwell said he was in shock when he saw only one ticket had won $ 53million and believed someone had scanned his ticket and put it on the website as a joke. ` it was april fool's day after all,' he added. The father - of - two kept the win to himself for four more hours until wife angela got home from helping to cook for a local oap luncheon club. He said :' i knew angela would be busy and wouldn't answer her mobile phone so i waited til she got home.'

After the westgate attack, al - shabaab unleashed a string of attacks in kenya that have killed more than 100 people - - assaulting the coastal town of mpeketoni on june 16, 2014 ; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the quran on november 22, 2014 ; and then, days later, executing christian quarry laborers. Why is al - shabaab, a somali nationalist, islamist group affiliated with al qaeda, targeting kenya? Al - shabaab says its attacks are to protest the more than 3, 500 kenyan soldiers participating in the african union peacekeeping mission in somalia. But if that is the case, why doesn't al - shabaab target kenyan military bases rather than attacking undefended so - called soft targets such as kenyan malls and universities? In fact, thursday's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of al - shabaab, which has steadily been losing ground for years in somalia as a result of the african union forces fighting them there, as well as a covert u. S. Drone and special operations forces campaign that has also degraded the group's capabilities. In 2006, al - shabaab controlled the somali capital of mogadishu and, in the following years, much of central and southern somalia.

Those aged 50-59 are the second fastest-growing group, says the report. The government said it was \"committed to providing suitable facilities\". The report comes as prisons minister andrew selous is due to give evidence on older prisoners to the commons justice select committee.

Why i fled : migrants share their stories. The smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of tripoli near the city's many ports, where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready. The building could only be reached by walking down a trash - littered alleyway, and featured a series of packed rooms, separated by curtains, where dozens sat - - well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat. The smuggler explained that the `` final price'' for syrians - - often thought to be richer than their african migrant counterparts - - was $ 1, 000. He added that for each syrian she brought with her, the producer would get a $ 100 discount. So if she brought 10, she could travel free. He explained how the `` discount'' was `` well known,'' suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat.

Although counsellor joseph brennan said the film's colour was \"beautiful\" and its scenery \"delightful\", he raised fears it would provoke protests from irish-americans. His concerns were addressed to the irish government's department of external affairs in a letter dated 17 april 1952, the irish times reports. He asked for a swift reply as he wanted to gauge the reaction to the film in ireland, but no response was received until june.

The dutchman is a slower version of the geordie, which is quite an achievement, and so more reinforcements are needed. That's why it would be a good idea for united to raid borussia dortmund. Ilkay gundogan has already been linked with a move to old trafford - - it's a no - brainer. This player is physical yet graceful. He can spot a pass and execute it first time.

      "Article": "The us senate has failed to pass a republican proposal to repeal president barack obama's signature healthcare policy without replacing it. The 45-55 vote marks the second defeat for republicans aiming to pass a bill this week to undo the health policy. The vote came a day after the senate rejected a plan to repeal and replace the health law with a republican plan. Senators will now consider a \"skinny\" repeal, which would scale back some of the more controversial provisions. The \"skinny\" plan would eliminate unpopular parts of obamacare - the affordable care act - including the individual mandate requiring all americans to have health insurance coverage as well as a tax on medical devices. If that measure passes, the senate and house of representatives would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still change during negotiations. If successful, the full house and senate would again have to approve the measure. Seven republicans opposed the repeal-only plan on wednesday, which included a two-year delay on a replacement in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses. The defeat is the latest blow for president donald trump, who put repealing obamacare at the centre of his election campaign, and underscores sharp divisions within the republican party over a replacement plan. A proposal to repeal and replace obamacare with the better care reconciliation act (bcra), a republican plan that was crafted over last two months, collapsed on tuesday night after nine republicans voted against it. Republicans have long railed against obamacare as government overreach, criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces, where premiums have risen sharply for some people. The party's proposed alternative included steep cuts to medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled. And it removes obamacare's individual mandate requiring all americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. About 20 million people gained health insurance under former president obama's affordable care act. The non-partisan congressional budgetary office (cbo) found the bill would strip 22 million americans of health insurance over the next decade. Other attempts to replace obamacare have failed in recent weeks due to republican divisions. In an early morning tweet on wednesday, mr trump lambasted republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska for opposing the party's plan, saying she \"really let the republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!\" Mrs murkowski was one of two republicans earlier on tuesday to vote against allowing the debate on healthcare legislation reform to go forward. But her party eked out a victory after vice president mike pence cast the tie-breaking vote which allowed discussion to take place. Senator john mccain, who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, received a standing ovation as he returned to congress to cast his \"yes\" vote. President trump tweeted his thanks to the arizona senator for playing \"such a vital role\" in the vote."

The arsenal manager, who has taken charge of 1, 056 matches since his appointment in september 1996, has lifted the lid on his pre - match rituals in an interview with the official arsenal magazine. Wenger said :' i always have eight or nine players of my team in my head the day before the game, but there's always a doubt on one or two. Arsene wenger has revealed the selection process he uses to pick his arsenal team. Wenger lifts the fa cup following arsenal's triumph over hull city at wembley last season. ` you try to make it as scientific as much as you can, but it's intuitive as well because you have to think if the balance of the team is right or if one player was a bit better in the last training session. ` when two players are together in your mind, competing for one position, every single detail can go for one of them - experience, confidence under pressure - everything can make a difference.' I always have a final chat with the medical people to make my mind up and make sure that everybody is alright. I do that on the morning of every game. Then i make my decision.' But even though the frenchman waits until the hours before the game to confirm his team, the overall selection process takes much longer. Wenger, drenched in champagne, is held aloft by his players after arsenal's fa cup win last season. Wenger said : `anyway, you always have your team in your head, for the whole week. You never go to bed without thinking about what the next line - up will be. ` you live with that always.

Judge aaron persky has been heavily criticised for giving student brock turner six months for assaulting an unconscious woman last year. Two other petitions have reached 115,000 and 175,000 signatures each. The petitions have no legal force but organisers hope they will increase pressure on politicians to act. Mr persky, a superior court judge in santa clara county, california, has reportedly received death threats in the wake of the case. The jail sentence he handed down to turner has been widely criticised as too lenient. Prosecutors had called for six years. Turner was seen by two other students sexually assaulting his victim, now 23, behind an outdoor rubbish bin. He tried to flee the scene but was caught and later admitted to the assault in court. Rights activists and members of the general public have accused mr persky of being influenced by turner's upbringing in a wealthy, white family, and his achievements as a college swimmer. The petition, posted on change.org, says that mr persky had \"failed to send the message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class, race, gender or other factors\". The judge said in his remarks that he was concerned about the \"severe impact\" a longer sentence would have on turner's life. Turner's father was also criticised after issuing a statement to the court saying his son was paying a steep price for only \"20 minutes of action\". Turner, who was a promising swimmer expected to compete for the us at olympic level, has been banned for life by usa swimming, the governing body for professional swimming in the us. The victim, who has not been named by the press, read an impact statement in court which was later read by millions. Us vice-president joe biden, who is involved in a campaign against campus assaults, wrote her an open letter praising her for her courage and saying he was \"filled with furious anger\" at the course of events.

Piedt, 25, playing just his second test, took four of the first five wickets to fall, including that of kohli whose fluent 70-run stand with rahane was ended in bizarre fashion. The india captain, who won the toss for a fourth time, smashed a full-blooded sweep into temba bavuma at short-leg and after the ball ballooned into the air, wicketkeeper dane vilas dived forward to take the catch. That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before rahane, who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in his first half century at home, steadied the innings and took india beyond 200. Rahane was helped by jadeja, whose 59-ball innings was ended by a smart dean elgar catch at midwicket off the bowling of abbott. South african abbott, who had earlier bowled cheteshwar pujara and wriddhiman saha, conceded just 23 runs in 17 overs to continue his push to start the four-test series against england, which begins on 26 december in durban."

The prime minister has invited his german counterpart for a working dinner at his country residence, chequers. The wide-ranging talks also cover the threat of so-called islamic state, the situation in iraq and ukraine. Mr cameron earlier welcomed estonian prime minister taavi roivas to downing street for bilateral talks. The meetings with his european counterparts come on the day that a new campaign to get the uk to leave the european union is being launched ahead of the in-out referendum, promised by 2017. Vote leave, made up of conservative, labour and ukip mps and donors, says it wants to negotiate a new deal based on free trade and friendly co-operation. Mr cameron has pledged to reform britain's relationship with the eu before holding a vote on membership and will discuss his aims with mrs merkel as part of his continuing negotiations with european leaders. The pair will also discuss the migrant crisis affecting europe, as european countries continue to struggle to cope with the influx of people reaching the continent from the middle east and africa. Russia's bombing campaign in syria is also likely to be raised at the meeting, as concerns grow about moscow's involvement in the war-torn country - as well as its backing for separatist rebels in eastern ukraine. During talks with the pm at downing street, estonian prime minister mr roivas thanked mr cameron for the uk's commitment to send 100 british military personnel to the baltic region. Defence secretary michael fallon has said the troops will deter russian aggression beyond ukraine and reassure eastern european nato members. Speaking at a press conference on friday, mr fallon - who held talks with his us counterpart ash carter in london - said the uk government was committed to building support for air strikes against is in syria. He said russia's military action had made a \"grave situation even worse\". The uk is currently involved in coalition air strikes against is targets in iraq but not syria, after parliament voted against the move in 2013."

The result was further embarrassment for michael o'neill's side after their 3-2 defeat by luxembourg last month. Paterson was among northern ireland players to miss great chances before the hosts scored two second-half goals. \"if you watched that game you're probably scratching your head wondering how have we lost 2-0. We are,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device. \"people might see the result and say'northern ireland lost 2-0, what a poor result that is' but they don't see how we've played. \"saying that, we've only got ourselves to blame. We dominated the game for 45 minutes but didn't take our chances and their goalkeeper played very well. \"then we just switched off for a couple of minutes, conceded, and the game changes. \"in the second half i hit the bar - it's a game of inches - and their second goal was just frustration.\" Another night of northern ireland ignominy ended with jonny evans being sent off for a crude foul, with mahir shukurov punishing the foul by netting the free-kick. After a night that proved a body blow to the team's hopes of a bright finish to their campaign, paterson still felt able to tentatively look on the bright side. With two points taken from a possible 12 against luxembourg and azerbaijan in the campaign, that might seem a stretch, but the 26-year-old gave it his best. Media playback is not supported on this device. \"there are positives to take, as mad as that sounds,\" said the huddersfield striker. \"i don't think we're miles away but it's a fine line. We had four or five good chances, they got one break and scored: that's international football. \"but we are still a young group. We've got to learn quickly and turn results around. \"if we do we have a chance of really pushing in the next campaign, but we have to work harder as a unit.\" Manager michael o'neill, who cut a frustrated figure in his post-match media duties, now faces the unenviable challenge of lifting a depleted squad for tuesday's final match in israel. Joining evans in being suspended for that match are defensive talisman gareth mcauley and midfielder oliver norwood, who each picked up their second bookings of the campaign. Northern ireland are unlikely to add to their squad in tel aviv, leaving o'neill to sift through his current group for answers. \"we have three players out but we also have men to come in - particularly the likes of sammy clingan and chris baird,\" added o'neill. \"we'll have to look at the centre-back situation because of the players we've lost to suspension and that is self inflicted.\""

It has been widely argued that germany's privacy laws were to blame for the tragedy. The times, for example, ran an article with the headline : `german obsession with privacy let killer pilot fly.' Similarly, another article published in time said : `german privacy laws let pilot `hide' his illness from employers.' While dirk fischer, german lawmaker and the transport spokesman for the christian democratic union ( cdu ), called for airlines to have mandatory access to pilots' medical records, frank ulrich montgomery, president of the german medical association ( bak ), disagreed. Co - pilot andreas lubitz, who purposefully crashed germanwings flight 9525, killing 150 people, had been treated for a psychiatric illness, it later emerged. The discovery sparked a debate over whether airlines should be given greater access to pilots' medical records. Mr montgomery believes that current laws are appropriate, since aviation doctors are already relieved of their duties of confidentiality if they think a pilot could put other people's lives at risk. If lubitz's doctor did not alert germanwings, it must have been because lubitz did not seem like a threat. There are two arguments for why lubitz's doctor did the right thing by not disclosing lubitz's depression to his employer. First, functional doctor - patient relationships depend on trust. If confidentiality between patients and doctors is breached, patients will no longer trust their doctors.

I am just happy we can give everyone in our country a historic moment.\" Federer, 33, also paid tribute to compatriot stan wawrinka, who helped set up the victory in lille by beating jo-wilfried tsonga before partnering federer to win the doubles. Federer and wawrinka were involved in a row at the atp tour finals in london, which the world number two later described as \"heat of the moment\". \"stan has put in so much effort over the years. He played an unbelievable weekend and that is what gave me the opportunity today,\" said federer. Federer, who lost his singles rubber to gael monfils on friday, played an inspired match as he crushed gasquet, who replaced tsonga due to an arm injury. In front of a passionate crowd of 27,448 - a world record for a competitive tennis match - federer dropped only four points on his imperious serve in the opening set, which he sealed with a whipping forehand winner. World number 26 gasquet dropped serve in the first and seventh games of the second set, which federer took without conceding a single break point. He broke the frenchman twice in the final set to serve for the match and claimed victory with a deft backhand drop shot - collapsing in tears onto the clay at the stade pierre-mauroyto.

      "Article": "Technology that allows a drone to be piloted from the ground using only a person's brainwaves has been demonstrated in portugal. 25 february 2015 last updated at 00:03 gmt. The company behind the development, tekever, said the technology could in the short term be used to enable people with restricted movement to control aircraft. Longer term the firm said piloting of larger jets, such as cargo planes, could be controlled in this way without the need for a crew on board. However, one aviation expert told the bbc he thought the industry would be unlikely to adopt such technology due to a perception of being potentially unsafe. Drone specialist tekever, which works with security firms, police forces and the military, adapted existing electroencephalography (eeg) technology so it could issue instructions to the software used to give the unmanned drone instructions. Eeg works by detecting activity in specific parts of the brain. After several months of training, \"pilots\" are said to be able to teach their brain how to think about moving a small circle on a computer screen either up or down, which in turn steers the drone left or right. \"we believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running,\" said ricardo mendes, tekever's chief operating officer. \"we truly believe that brainflight represents the beginning of a tremendous step change in the aviation field, empowering pilots and de-risking missions, and we're looking forward to deliver these benefits to the market with highly innovative products.\" In the future, some of this technology may be put to use to control much larger aircraft, although mr mendes acknowledged considerable challenges with both regulatory hurdles and public confidence. Those concerns were echoed by john strickland, an independent aviation consultant based in london. \"this to me is certainly at the moment a bridge too far,\" he told the bbc. \"you could get someone radically-minded who might say it, but i'd be surprised if anyone would do it.\" Mr strickland said the airline industry was instead focusing its innovation efforts towards things like better materials and more economical engines. Mr mendes said the technology would incorporate safety measures to counteract the effects of someone having, for example, a seizure while piloting. \"there are algorithms on board that prevent bad things from happening,\" he told the bbc. He added: \"technology is evolving, regulations are evolving. [unmanned jets are] obviously going to happen. The question is not if, it's when.\" Follow dave lee on twitter @daveleebbc."

Ronan toolis led the excavation works at trusty's hill fort at gatehouse of fleet. It unearthed evidence that it might have been the royal seat of the sixth century kingdom of rheged. Mr toolis said it was \"pre-eminent among the kingdoms of the north\" at that time. The location of rheged had previously been thought by many historians to be in cumbria. However, dr christopher bowles, co-director of the excavation work in dumfries and galloway, said that may not have been the case. \"the new archaeological evidence from trusty's hill enhances our perception of power, politics, economy and culture at a time when the foundations for the kingdoms of scotland, england and wales were being laid,\" he said. \"the 2012 excavations show that trusty's hill was likely the royal seat of rheged, a kingdom that had galloway as its heartland. \"this was a place of religious, cultural and political innovation whose contribution to culture in scotland has perhaps not been given due recognition.\" Dr bowles said the influence of the kingdom had \"rippled through the history and literature of scotland and beyond\". Mr toolis added that they had not been looking for rheged when they started the excavations. \"what drew us to trusty's hill were pictish symbols carved on to bedrock here, which are unique in this region and far to the south of where pictish carvings are normally found,\" said mr toolis. \"the galloway picts project was launched in 2012 to recover evidence for the archaeological context of these carvings. \"but far from validating the existence of galloway picts, the archaeological context revealed by our excavation instead indicates the carvings relate to a royal stronghold and place of inauguration for the local britons of galloway around ad 600. \"the new archaeological evidence suggests that galloway may have been the heart of the lost dark age kingdom of rheged, a kingdom that was in the late sixth century pre-eminent amongst the kingdoms of the north.\" The two men have produced a new book which details their findings.

      "Article": "( cnn ) there is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today's jihadi fighters. We are all familiar with the brutality of isis, the self - anointed islamic state, or boko haram, the nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to isis. This new wave of violent islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose : it is part of the larger plan of building a `` caliphate,'' a sharia - ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group's interpretation of life in the early days of islam. Yazidi girls who slipped isis after its siege of mount sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for isis fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by human rights watch found `` a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by isis forces,'' actions that the group says `` are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity.' ' in nigeria, boko haram also has a very specific approach to women. The 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2, 000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014, according to amnesty"

The research, carried out in milan, backs up tests carried out by the charity medical detection dogs. Its co - founder dr claire guest said the charity's research found a 93 per cent reliability rate when detecting both prostate and bladder cancer. She hailed the new study, describing the findings as `spectacular'. Dogs have been found to detect prostate cancer with 98 per cent accuracy when sniffing men's urine samples. The latest research, by the department of urology at the humanitas clinical and research centre in milan, involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without. Scientists found that dog one got it right in 98. 7 per cent of cases, while for dog two this was 97. 6 per cent. They said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the uk, with more than 40, 000 new cases diagnosed every year. Dr guest said : `these results are spectacular. They offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer. ` it is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer, for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate.' She said there is currently a `reluctance to embrace this tested, time - old technology' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts.

But the probe will soon be beaming back much sharper images and a wealth of other information about pluto's remote, unexplored corner of the solar system. ` `this is pure exploration ; we're going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes,'' said alan stern, new horizons' principal investigator. Launched in 2006, new horizons is nearing the crucial point in its epic voyage of more than 3 billion miles. The probe is due to make its closest approach to pluto on july 14. ` `in an unprecedented flyby this july, our knowledge of what the pluto system is really like will expand exponentially, and i have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries,'' said john grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of the nasa science mission directorate. Discovered in 1930, pluto was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system. But scientists have since revised that view because of pluto's size and location, demoting it to the status of `` dwarf planet'' : a planet that's too small to clear other objects out of its way. Pluto is 1, 400 miles wide, roughly half the width of the continental united states. At 3. 6 billion miles out in the solar system, it's about 40 times as far from the sun as earth is.

If confirmed by the senate, james comey will replace outgoing director robert mueller iii, serving for 10 years. At the white house, mr obama praised mr comey as a model of \"fierce independence and deep integrity\". Mr comey is known for successfully opposing a warrantless wiretapping programme backed by other bush aides. Mr mueller took up his post shortly before the 9/11 attacks and is retiring as director on 4 september. In remarks on friday, mr obama said the outgoing director had displayed \"a steady hand and strong leadership\" during his time at the head of the fbi. The us president said mr comey had \"law enforcement in his blood\". \"as a young prosecutor in the us attorney's office in manhattan he helped bring down the gambino crime family; as a federal prosecutor in virginia he led an aggressive effort to combat gun violence that reduced homicide rates and saved lives,\" mr obama said. He also joked that mr comey - who is 6ft, 8in tall (2.03m) -  was \"a man who stands up very tall for justice and the rule of law\". The nominee said he could not describe his excitement to work again with the fbi. \"they are men and women who have devoted their lives to serving and protecting others and i simply can't wait to be their colleague,\" he said. One of the most dramatic episodes of mr comey's tenure as deputy attorney general in the bush administration came in 2004, when then-attorney general john ashcroft was ill in hospital. Mr bush's white house counsel alberto gonzales and chief of staff andrew card pressed him in his hospital bed to re-authorise a controversial programme allowing federal agents to eavesdrop on phone conversations without a warrant. Mr comey, who was acting as attorney general in mr ashcroft's stead, rushed to the hospital and intervened. Changes were subsequently made to the programme and mr comey drew wide praise. Mr obama alluded to the incident on friday, saying mr comey \"was prepared to give up a job he loved rather than be part of something he felt was fundamentally wrong\". After leaving the bush administration, mr comey was general counsel for bridgewater associates, a hedge fund in the us state of connecticut. He now lectures at columbia university law school in new york. Before he became deputy attorney general, mr comey had a long tenure at the justice department, serving in many posts including as us attorney for the southern district of new york."

Ospreys are playing in the second-tier european tournament for the first time and have a 100% record after wins over newcastle falcons and lyon. Grenoble lost heavily when they played the same teams. The two teams meet again on saturday, 17 december. Ospreys head coach steve tandy told bbc radio wales:. \"it's pretty poor and disappointing. We came down to the ground at 3pm and the ground was hard. The blowers and a little bit of hot air has gone on it to try and rectify it but i think it was too little too late. \"it's bitterly disappointing, it affects preparations. Now we've got to stay out here. It's not as if it's an anomaly where you come here and there's a big blizzard. \"there's definitely been a lack of preparation and thought gone into it and for such a big game for us, we're bitterly disappointed we haven't played the game tonight.\" Grenoble: armand batlle; pierre mignot,clement gelin, nigel hunt, tino nemani; gilles bosch, david mele;  alexandre dardet, tienne fourcade, walter desmaison, mickael capelli,  mathias marie, kevin kornath, steven setephano, dylan hayes.

You can't blame him for joining liverpool - - why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker - - playing regularly in the premier league and scoring goals for southampton. He'd just been to a world cup. Rickie lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining liverpool despite their striking problems. Brendan rodgers' decision to ignore lambert, in favour of mario balotelli, is completely illogical. This time last year lambert was about to play at a world cup for england but his stock has fallen since. For rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware lambert isn't luis suarez, i know he's not a world - class striker. Lambert missed out on saturday at west brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see mario balotelli get yet another chance. The england striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of premier league minutes on the pitch lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six - and - a - half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football. When he has started in the premier league or champions league, lambert and liverpool have impressed. On his first premier league start for liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver. He has to go down as liverpool's worst - ever"

Under premier league regulations the 20 - year - old is entitled to `buy - out' the last year of his current contract which runs out in 2017. The effect of that would see the fee liverpool could command for the forward dramatically reduce. Raheem sterling has rejected a new $ 100, 000 - a - week contract with liverpool and could leave this summer. The 20 year - old could lower his value by buying - out the last year of his current deal for $ 1. 7 million. Liverpool insist they will hold firm and not be forced into selling sterling in the close season. However, the reds would have to reconsider their stance if sterling and his advisers go down the route of buying out a chunk of his contract. It is understood liverpool value sterling as high as $ 50million given his age, talent and potential. However, if sterling effectively only had one year left on his contract that fee would be reduced considerably - perhaps even in half to $ 25 million. With sterling currently on a $ 35, 000 a week, it would cost the england international $ 1. 7 m to buy out the last year of his contract. That sum could swiftly be recouped in the form of a signing on fee with a new club and, of course, in wages. Manchester city and chelsea are both keen on sterling, pictured racing against philippe coutinho. Sterling's value could plummet by up to $ 25million is he chooses to buy - out the final year of his contract.

Benchmark brent crude hit $50.22 per barrel at one stage on thursday, its highest level since early november. The rise followed us data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in canada. Brent crude has now risen 80% since it hit 13-year lows of below $28 a barrel at the start of the year. Us crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to may 20, according to us department of energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the us and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between opec and russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from iran and saudi arabia. As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in canada, attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in nigeria. Demand has also been better than expected from major economies such as china, india and russia. Michael hewson, chief market analyst at cmc markets, said: \"we do now appear to be seeing the effects that the decline in us output is having, and while supplies remain elevated, the glut does now appear to be diminishing.\" Against this backdrop, analysts are starting to raise their forecasts. Goldman sachs said earlier this month that it now expected oil prices to consistently hit $50 a barrel in the second half of 2016 and $60 by the end of 2017. The us bank said: \"the oil market continues to deliver its share of surprises, with low prices driving disruptions in nigeria, higher output in iran and better demand. \"with each of these shifts significant in magnitude, the oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.\" In a sign of growing confidence, oil companies have started preparing for higher prices. Bp said last month it had budgeted for prices of at least between $50 and $55 a barrel in 2017. And last month us oil producer pioneer natural resources announced plans to add up to 10 new rigs when the oil price gets back up to $50. Adam laird, an investment manager at hargreaves lansdown, told the bbc: \"this is an area that's been starved of resources and investment and that psychological barrier [of $50] could be enough to make some executives reassess.\" However, mr laird cautioned that price volatility was likely to continue. \"it's too early to say this is the beginning of the big rebound,\" he said. Abhishek deshpande, an oil markets analyst at natixis, agreed and said: \"we believe that the market is going up, but if it goes too quickly there will be auto-corrections.\""

Six authorities have told bbc wales a meltdown in waste markets has hit their budgets. Pembrokeshire council has seen the price it gets for steel drop by 88% over the year - while flintshire has seen the price for plastics halved. Experts say a slump in oil prices, cheap steel imports, and china's economic slowdown are to blame. \"we try to play the markets as best we can,\" harvey mitchell, the waste services manager for flintshire, said. \"it makes it difficult when we do have a drop in issues we can't control, such as the global price of oil, or when larger countries flood the european market with steel.\" Flintshire has been celebrating a record year for recycling household waste - up to 58% of everything thrown away now ends up at its waste recover facility in buckley. \"but while we've seen an increase in the amount of material we've collected, we've actually seen a drop in the income because of the market prices,\" mr mitchell said. Recycled waste netted the council \u00a3537,000 in revenue in 2015/16, but this represented a drop of 45% in the expected income - more than \u00a3400,000 in lost cash. The pattern has been repeated in pembrokeshire, where \u00a3360,000 has been wiped off the council's expected income, while four other councils saw a combined drop of \u00a3335,000. \"this is an issue which is impacting upon wales as a whole, not just pembrokeshire,\" a council official there said. \"fortunately quotes for the coming months are starting to look more positive with prices starting to increase.\" The impact on most of the other welsh councils which responded to bbc wales has been minimal, as they said are tied into long term contracts dealing with their recycling services. But one academic expert said authorities and the public in wales will need to refocus as they face ever increasing targets on recycling. By 2025 welsh authorities are being asked to recycle 70% of waste - by 2050, it should be 100%. \"waste prevention is what this is all about,\" rebecca colley-jones, from bangor university's sustainability lab, said. \"it's about buying smartly, being able to think about what you do with it so it can be reused, because reuse is a form of waste prevention. \"together we can provide solutions for the future.\""

Delegates at the alzheimer's research uk conference heard that the university of nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics. It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said. The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and apoe. But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease. Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test. Prof kevin morgan from the university of nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients. But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising. \"our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with alzheimer's using a blood test. \"as blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future.\" He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment. It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained. Potentially, it could be a \"cheap and easy pre-screen\" test which enabled alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said. \"the way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk. \"if they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing.\" Dr eric karran, director of research at alzheimer's research uk, said: \"giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy, and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital. \"while there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available, the results are promising. \"when used alongside other diagnostic techniques, a blood test like this could be a real help.\""

The trip was highly anticipated. After all, this was to have been kim's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father's death, and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery. But this week, russia announced that the trip had been canceled, with kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov saying thursday that moscow was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen. He said that `` the decision is connected with north korean domestic affairs.' ' what could have changed kim's mind? It is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty, but a possible explanation is that kim may not be feeling completely secure in his position. And nervous dictators prefer to stay home. True, kim runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on earth. And there is unceasing public praise for the younger `dear leader,'' including frenzied eruptions of support. But these eruptions are carefully scripted, and those who have managed to flee the north confirm that in private, many are unhappy with the regime. Perhaps with the potential threats in mind, kim feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power. In 2013, kim shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle, jang song thaek, who had stood by his side from the day his father died. Jang had mentored and guided the young kim as he took the reins, but the once - powerful jang was arrested by soldiers during a politburo meeting who dragged him away in a chilling scene broadcast on"

The next public consultation in the greater manchester spatial framework (gmsf) scheme was due in september but may not be published until summer 2018. Regional mayor andy burnham promised to revise the plans following protests from affected communities. The revised plans will be announced \"in due course\", the mayor's office said. The gmsf scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years. The area's combined authority, which brings together 10 councils, published a joint plan last october to allocate land for development. Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth, it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes. The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans. Mr burnham, who was elected as metropolitan mayor in may, promised to \"radically re-write\" the plans, calling them \"unfair and disproportionate\". The bbc understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved. Matthew collinge from the save our slattocks group, which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between middleton and royton, said the delay was \"disappointing\". He said: \"it stretches out the fear of the unknown and us. It's very easy for people to lose interest and we've been working towards this september deadline. \"we now have to keep people aware of what's happening for longer and that makes it harder for a small community group like ours.\" Matthew good, a spokesman for the house builder's federation said: \"it's important for everybody that we have some certainty on this. \"councils need to invest in infrastructure. They need to know where those developments are going to happen. \"without a plan it's going to be a lot more piecemeal because investors will have to take chances on where they can get development and the councils may not be in control of that.\" A spokesman for mr burnham said the mayor had appointed salford city mayor paul dennett to lead a \"radical\" rewrite of the plans. He added: \"this re-write is currently underway and details on the next round of consultation will be announced in due course.\""

There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told russian television on thursday. It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said oleg kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby sakhalin region.

The conservative politician was in scotland a day after the scottish government published its draft independence referendum bill. He met his scottish government counterpart michael russell for talks. When asked if the first minister is being \"realistic\" with her demands, he said: \"they are both reserved powers. Immigration and international affairs are both reserved powers.\" Before the eu referendum in june, leading brexit campaigner and then justice secretary michael gove had suggested scotland could get powers over immigration as part of a deal to leave the eu. But mr davis said: \"it's hard to see how a separate immigration policy would work.\" He insisted the brexit arrangements would be a \"united kingdom deal\", rejecting the idea put forward by the scottish government that the country should be able to keep its place in the european single market. First minister nicola sturgeon has said a referendum will be called if it is felt necessary to \"protect scotland's interests\" in the wake of the brexit vote. But she has insisted her government was \"exploring all of the options\" for safeguarding scotland's place in europe, and has said she will publish proposals in the coming weeks for keeping scotland in the european single market even if the uk leaves. After his first meeting with mr davis, mr russell said he expected to soon be able to announce a formal process for scottish input into the brexit process. Speaking at strathclyde university in glasgow, mr davis said while it has \"got to be a united kingdom deal\", it would \"incorporate protection for the people of scotland\". He also said the eventual agreement would \"reflect the interests of the people of scotland\". Mr davis stated: \"the aim is to get the maximum possible barrier-free access to the european union market, as well as being able to get other markets globally. \"how we achieve that? We're not at that stage yet, but that's the aim.\" He continued: \"i don't think the scottish people want another referendum, but that's for them. \"i have simply got the single aim in front of me, which is to get the best deal possible, and that includes the best deal for the scottish people.\" Yesterday the prime minister of malta, joseph muscat, said that he thinks the united kingdom might actually rein back on brexit. Mr davis told bbc scotland that is not the case: \"that's not going to happen.

He told fox news the democrats were putting out the reports because they were embarrassed at the scale of the election defeat. On friday, cia officials told us media they had concluded that russians hackers were trying to help mr trump. Russian officials have repeatedly denied the hacking accusations. Mr trump said it might have been russia but it was impossible to know. \"they have no idea if it's russia or china or somebody sitting in a bed some place,\" he said. President barack obama has ordered a complete review of the hacks, which targeted emails at the democratic party and the emails of a key aide to presidential nominee hillary clinton. The contents of the emails, passed to wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the democrats and shook up the presidential campaign. Senior republicans have now joined democrats in calling for a full investigation. Republican senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said in a joint statement on sunday with top democrats that the cia's report \"should alarm every american\". He said in an interview that the congressional investigation should be more thorough than the one ordered by the white house. In october, us government officials pointed the finger at russia, accusing it of meddling in the campaign to undermine the electoral process. But on friday, the intelligence community went further when us media reports said the cia had \"high confidence\" that russians were trying to influence the election in mr trump's favour. Russians had hacked the republican party but chose not to reveal the contents of what they found, the reports said. But mr trump told fox news sunday: \"i think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it.\" He said the democrats were behind the news reports, not the cia, because they suffered such a big defeat. While backing the obama review, the president-elect warned that it should not pin the blame solely on russia but on other countries or individuals too. Republican party spokesman sean spicer said the party had not been hacked and the intelligence report was wrong. Mr trump also said in the interview he did not need daily intelligence briefings. \"i'm a smart person, i don't need to be told the same thing in the same way for eight years.\" Elsewhere in the interview, he said:. Mr trump, an outsider who stunned the political world by beating hillary clinton in last month's election, will assume office on 20 january. Why trump strikes a chord with russians. Russia's putin calls trump'a clever man' are there any trump links to putin?"

Jerome lavrilleux said the former president was not aware of the \"slip\". It comes after a lawyer for an event organiser accused the ump of ordering almost 11m euros ($15m; \u00e2\u00a39m) worth of fake invoices to cover overspends. Reports say the scandal could damage the party and complicate any efforts by mr sarkozy to be re-elected. Police searched the headquarters of the ump in paris on monday afternoon. \"there have been anomalies,\" mr lavrilleux, a deputy director of mr sarkozy's 2012 presidential campaign, told france's bfm tv. With tears in his eyes. \"there was no wrongdoing, there was a terrible spiral, a train going at high speed and people who should have pulled the emergency alarm and didn't, and i was probably one of them,\" he said. He said mr sarkozy, ump chairman jean-francois cope and batien millot, the founder of the events company bygmalion, were not aware of the actions taken. It comes after patrick maisonneuve, the lawyer for bygmalion, told the same television station that the centre-right ump had ordered fake invoices to cover exploding campaign costs. He said it was made clear to bygmalion that if it did not comply, it would not be paid. The ump's chairman was already facing growing speculation that he will have to step down after the french newspaper liberation reported this month that the party paid some 20m euros to a unit of bygmalion, founded by two associates of mr cope, to organise campaign events. Mr cope told bmf tv earlier on monday that he knew nothing of any wrongdoing. He said he had put his trust in the people who were responsible for the party's accounts and did not think he had to look over their shoulders. Mr cope was already expected to face challenges for the leadership of the party after the ump's poor result in the european parliament elections. It came second to the far-right front national. Mr sarkozy, who lost the presidency to francois hollande in 2012, is rumoured to be preparing to make a comeback in 2017. He has not commented on the scandal over his 2012 campaign finances."

On 11 january, 32-year-old whittingham will have been with the bluebirds a decade, but his latest deal in the welsh capital runs out in the summer. It looks certain whittingham will commit his future to the bluebirds by signing a new contract. \"we'll talk about that before the fa cup probably,\" said warnock. Cardiff face fulham in the third round of the fa cup on sunday, 8 december, but before that, on monday 2 january, the bluebirds entertain whittingham's former club, aston villa in the championship. Back in 2007, then-cardiff boss dave jones, bought whittingham from villa for a fee of \u00a3350,000. Since then, the dead-ball specialist has established himself as one of the most popular players ever to pull on a cardiff shirt. He has been named in the championship team of the season three times and, in 2015, he was included in the football league team of the decade. Whittingham also finished joint-top scorer in the championship in the 2009-10 campaign having found the net 20 times in the league for the bluebirds. During his time with cardiff, whittingham has turned down the chance of a move away from the welsh club. This season he is currently the club's joint-top scorer in the league having found the net five times so far. But despite that, warnock says he will not be rushed into a new contract to keep the midfielder. \"that's the least of my worries at the minute. I haven't sorted my own [contract] out yet, let alone peter's,\" joked warnock. \"peter knows, i've said to him,'you'll be here as long as me peter' and he laughed and said, i know, that's what worries me. \"no, we've got a few days [before the fulham game] then we've got no league points to worry about so we'll probably have a chat during that period.\""

The 30-year-old complained about her portrayal in the media as a partying child-killer. Anthony was convicted of lying to police but acquitted of murder. Casey anthony: the case that gripped the us. If found guilty she could have faced the death penalty under florida law. \"my sentence was doled out long before there was a verdict. Sentence first, verdict afterward,\" she said. \"people found me guilty long before i had my day in court.\" The 2011 case drew millions of viewers across the us, with every twist covered on live television. Anthony was dubbed \"america's most hated mom\" amid reports she went to nightclubs and got a tattoo in the month her daughter was missing. Last week the former judge that presided over the case spoke out to say that anthony \"more than likely\" accidently killed her daughter by using too much chloroform to calm her before suffocating her with duct tape. During the trial, her defence argued that the girl drowned in the pool, and that anthony and her father covered it up. The government failed to secure a conviction due to the lack of physical evidence tying her to caylee's death. When asked about the drowning defence, anthony hesitated. \"everyone has their theories, i don't know.

Huangdi is considered the ancestor of the qingming festival which sees the chinese mark the start of spring with outdoor celebrations. Lines of dancers take to the stage as part of the celebration, which was watched by thousands of people during the public holiday. Around 1. 3 billion chinese people marked the qingming festival, a three - day holiday in china, by watching parades and travelling home. Traditional chinese dancers wear intricate gowns as they swirl and dance in the sunshine during the celebrations in the city of huangi. An actor dressed as a soldier takes a break from the celebration to check his phone. In shaanxi province, a huge outdoor celebration was held as part of the qingming festival and in honour of the `yellow emperor' huang di, considered the founding father of the chinese nation. A bell was rung from the top of the city's temple, while the drums were struck 34 times, one for each of china's provinces including hong kong, macao, and taiwan. The festival falls in the first week of april every year, and is one of the 24 chinese solar terms - the date from which temperatures rise, rainfall increases and marks an important time for the land to be prepared for the sowing of seeds.

According to the article, Huangdi **is** the \"Yellow Emperor\" (not the ancestor of the festival named after him), and he is considered the ancestor of the Chinese nation, as well as being associated with the Qingming Festival (which means \"Pure Brightness\"). The summary misrepresents the relationship between Huangdi and the \"Yellow Emperor\" title.\nSeverity: 4\n\nError 2:\nLocation: \"The chinese mark the start of spring with outdoor celebrations.\" (in the context of the entire summary)\nExplanation: While this statement is generally true according to the article, in the context of the summary, it implies that the primary purpose of the Qingming Festival is to mark the start of spring. The article provides a more nuanced view, highlighting both the honoring of ancestors and the celebration of spring's arrival as part of the broader Qingming Festival (which includes the Tomb Sweeping aspect). This simplification could be seen as omitting crucial context, but since it doesn't introduce new factual inconsistencies directly, its severity is lower.\nSeverity: 2\n\nOverall score: Fair\nExplanation of the score: The summary contains a significant error regarding Huangdi's role (Error 1, Severity 4), which affects its factual consistency. Additionally, while Error 2 does not introduce new inaccuracies, it simplifies the festival's purpose in a way that might be misleading without the full context provided by the article. These issues prevent the summary from achieving a 'Good' or higher score, but since they do not render the entire summary factually inconsistent, the overall score is 'Fair'.\n```"

While johnson's victory wouldn't raise an eyebrow nowadays, it caused consternation in america for one simple reason : johnson was black - - and a black man had never held sport's greatest prize. Racism was rife in america : black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life. As the great boxing pundit bert sugar put it, `this was the white man's crown. ( to white america ), it was as if the white man's slave had become his master.' After beating tommy burns in 1908, jack johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion. It is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that johnson's victory caused. Even liberal newspapers, such as the new york times, were openly hostile to the giant texan. It mattered little that johnson was american. His skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white america to find a white challenger - - a `great white hope' - - who could unseat the new champion. But little did white america know that it would take over six years before johnson would be defeated, on april 5, 1915, 100 years ago on sunday. Most had believed johnson would be dispatched quickly. However, he made short work of his first four title defences, his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion stanley ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock johnson down. Yet johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and, as soon as he returned to his feet, scored a brutal knockout, uprooting several of ketchel's teeth in the process.

The latest row comes just weeks after the anc forced an art gallery to withdraw a painting showing mr zuma with his genitals exposed. Mr zuma is set to face zapiro in court in october over a different cartoon. The president sued the cartoonist, who works for the mail & guardian newspaper, after he depicted mr zuma in 2008 about to rape a female figure representing justice. Mr zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006. The pair have also clashed over zapiro's portrayal of mr zuma with a shower cap on his head - a reference to mr zuma's statement in the rape trial that he had taken a shower after having sex to reduce the chance of contracting hiv. \"we find it unacceptable and shocking that after the harsh experiences that south africa, the president and his family has experienced few weeks ago, that zapiro and the mail & guardian will find it appropriate to continue with the insults and hurt to the president, his family and the broader anc constituency,\" the anc said in a statement. \"all south africans share our disgust.\" The painting in the gallery triggered a huge debate in south africa about the freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Before the gallery agreed to remove the painting, called the spear, it was vandalised by two men.

      "Article": "Scientists from harvard medical school have discovered a way of turning stem cells into killing machines to fight brain cancer. In experiments on mice, the stem cells were genetically engineered to produce and secrete toxins which kill brain tumours, without killing normal cells or themselves. Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans. A stem cell expert said this was \"the future\" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal stem cells, was the work of scientists from massachusetts general hospital and the harvard stem cell institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr khalid shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school, said the results were very positive. \"after doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells.\" He added: \"cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life.\" But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. \"now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs.\" Chris mason, professor of regenerative medicine at university college london, said: \"this is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. \"it shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. \"cells can do so much. This is the way the future is going to be.\" Nell barrie, senior science information manager for cancer research uk, said it was an \"ingenious approach\". \"we urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it's needed. \"but so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab, so much more work will need to be done before we'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours.\" She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers. Dr shah now plans to test the technique using a number of different therapies on mice with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumour in human adults. He hopes the therapies could be used in clinical trials within the next five years."

Nepal makes millions of dollars every year from the everest industry but has been criticised for poor management. In 2014, the mountain was closed after 16 sherpas (guides) died in an accident. And earlier this year, the climbing season was called off after a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche that killed 18 climbers.

Official celebrations are planned, as well as large protests from pro-democracy and pro-beijing camps. Several well-known activists were arrested on the eve of mr xi's arrival. The group, which included student leader joshua wong, had staged a protest at an iconic sculpture symbolising the handover. The golden sculpture of a bauhinia flower - hong kong's emblem - by the city's harbour was a gift from china. Mr xi arrived for the three-day visit with his wife peng liyuan at the city's main chek lap kok airport. The couple were welcomed by a marching band and children waving flags.

Beijing's central government \"has always been a strong backer of hong kong\" and \"will, as always, support hong kong's economic development and improvement of people's lives\".

Beijing agreed to govern it under \"one country, two systems\", granting the city its own legal system, limited democracy with multiple political parties, and rights like freedom of assembly and free speech.

But parts of hong kong are under a tight security lockdown amid worries of further protests, with several major roads closed and sections of the city centre blocked off from the public. Thousands of police officers are being deployed across the city and along the route mr xi's motorcade will take when it enters the city. When former president hu jintao visited for the 15-year celebrations in 2012, he was met with hundreds of thousands of protesters, marching against what they saw as beijing's stifling influence on political reform in the city. Tensions spilled over into mass protests in the city centre in september 2014, with calls for full democracy and the resignation of then-chief executive cy leung."

Anastasia deyeva, 24, has been appointed a deputy interior minister, unprecedented for anyone of her age. And some ukrainians think she is not qualified for the job. \"there's nothing wrong about a woman being an adviser, especially if she's pretty and smart,\" was one typical comment on facebook. \"but it's very wrong if she's that young and has no experience. Or the wrong kind of experience.\" As debate swirled around ms deyeva's appointment, another young woman was selected for the highly charged job of running a campaign to purge the government of corrupt officials. Anna kalynchuk, 23, studied law and was already part of the government's anti-corruption department. Ms deyeva had to deal with closer scrutiny than most public officials when nude photos of her were posted online. More tasteful pictures have since appeared on ukrainian lifestyle website style insider. Nothing to do with her work, insisted ms deyeva. She defended her credentials, telling one interviewer (in russian) she had exactly the right experience for the job. She was an aide to an mp, worked for a swedish energy company and was considered suitably qualified enough to be offered an interior ministry job in 2015. But her promotion to become ukraine's youngest ever deputy minster unleashed a torrent of criticism. \"i knew that i'd end up in the limelight, that there would be criticism and biased commentary. But i never expected such vile attacks,\" she says. Ms deyeva's boss, interior minister arsen avakov, is firmly behind her. \"the main thing people have against her is that she's young,\" he wrote on his facebook page (in russian), adding that the criticism was based on outdated attitudes. \"in the soviet tradition, this sort of job was for a monster, but we've hired a girl. Maybe so, only we do things differently in my ministry,\" he said. He is not alone in thinking it is time for ukraine to move on. \"i am extremely glad that you're one generation younger than me,\" wrote denis kazvan, formerly an interior ministry adviser. \"people like you do not need to spend 40 years wandering through the desert to get rid of the soviet gene of slavery.

For most of those years, the money was deep at the bottom of the atlantic, the monetary casualty of a cruel world war ii sinking. In november 1942, the unguarded ss city of cairo was sunk by a german u - boat while carrying 296 civilians and cargo that included 100 tons of silver. The vessel sunk to more than 16, 800 feet under the surface ( 5, 150 meters ) where it went undiscovered until 2011 when deep ocean search decided to go looking for it. The sinking was the stuff of legend. The city of cairo was bringing silver rupees from india to england as part of the war effort. After a stop in brazil, two torpedos sank the ship in the atlantic. After the ship went under, the u - boat reportedly surfaced and the captain said to the survivors in lifeboats : `` goodnight, sorry for sinking you.'

The year 2011 refers to when Deep Ocean Search located and recovered silver coins from the wreck, not when the ship sank.

The world - renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A medical practitioners tribunal service hearing in manchester was told a man referred to as patient a had suffered `extensive injuries' to the right side of his face in an industrial accident.

Thousands of border agency workers are expected to strike on 30 november in protest at government pension changes. Ministers fear there could be major disruption for travellers, so volunteers are being asked to step in. Pcs union chief mark serwotka said ministers were in a \"blind panic\" and should be resolving the dispute. The uk border agency has insisted the civil servants will be properly trained. It is expected they would mainly check the passports of travellers arriving from the european economic area and man so-called \"e-gates\" where passengers use their biometric passports. A ukba spokesman said: \"the security of the uk border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union action.\" However, union chiefs expressed concern that the officials might not be properly trained and that borders could be put at risk. Mr serwotka, general secretary of the public and commercial services union, blamed ministers for leaving it so late to try and resolve the dispute. He told bbc radio 4's today programme that the call to civil servants was an example of \"blind panic\" at the 11th hour, he said, and accused the government of engaging in a misleading \"pr exercise\" about public sector pensions to try to force through \"damaging\" changes. \"instead of scratching around trying to put untrained people on the front line, they should say today they want urgent talks to try to resolve the dispute,\" he said. The government has confirmed earlier reports that ukba is planning to fly some officials home from overseas positions to help deal with the strike. In the wake of the recent row between home secretary theresa may and former uk border force chief brodie clark over the relaxation of controls during the summer, it is extremely unlikely that officials would be prepared to bypass any rules to ease the pressure of queues. The bbc has also learned that the government has told union bosses that they are not prepared to offer any further concessions over pension reforms as a result of the planned strikes. The government recently made what it describes as an improved offer to the unions, promising that public sector workers ten years away from retirement would not see any change to their pensions. It also promised improved accrual rates. Ministers fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill. Ministers argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy, but they insist that even after the planned changes, state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector. Unions say their members are being asked to work longer, contribute more and receive less."

The rise was notable among men who have sex with men. At the same time, rates of genital warts decreased, thanks to a vaccination campaign. Rates of sexually transmitted infections as a group also went down slightly, totalling 434,456. But experts say this could be because fewer people came forward for testing. Chlamydia was the most commonly diagnosed sti, accounting for nearly half of the cases diagnosed in 2015. Young people are routinely offered chlamydia screening, but only 13% of young men and 32% of young women were tested in 2015. The large fall in genital warts - a 7% drop - was seen in young women, and experts say this was probably because of the national human papilloma virus vaccination programme. All girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the jab as part of the nhs childhood vaccination programme. The fpa charity's chief executive, natika halil, said boys should be offered the vaccine too, which is something ministers are considering. Genevieve edwards, of marie stopes uk, said the statistics should \"set alarm bells ringing\" about the availability of sexual health services for young people and men who have sex with men. \"we have to keep a focus on preventing sexual ill health, and providing prompt diagnosis and treatment to those who need it,\" she added. The british association for sexual health and hiv said the continued rise of gonorrhoea was extremely disturbing, given the further spread of drug-resistant infections. Dr gwenda hughes, head of sti surveillance at phe, said: \"we need to do more to raise awareness about stis and how they can be prevented, especially the effectiveness of using condoms. \"we recommend that anyone having sex with a new or casual partner uses condoms and tests regularly for hiv and stis.\""

      "Article": "The bbc has confirmed the \"global\" version of its iplayer on-demand service will close next month. The corporation had charged users subscription fees to watch programmes via the app in western europe, australia and canada. However, it never came to the us. Reports suggest american pay-tv operators had threatened to drop the bbc america channel if the app had launched locally because they believed it would cost them viewers. Both bbc america and the international edition of iplayer screen some of the corporation's best known programmes, including doctor who, top gear, sherlock and david attenborough's natural history documentaries. Press releases had always described the online facility as a \"pilot\" meant to provide \"consumer insights\". Bbc worldwide - the broadcaster's commercial arm -  first announced it intended to pull support for the global iplayer app in october 2013, saying it would instead focus on making material available via the bbc.com website. The corporation repeated the point in its annual review last july, but until now had not provided an exact shut-off date. \"as announced in july 2014, the service will be closing this year as planned,\" said a spokeswoman. \"the service will close on 26 june.\" She declined to provide usage statistics. The global iplayer app was first made available as an ios app in july 2011 but was never extended beyond apple's platform. European users were charged a \u20ac5.99 (\u00a34.30) monthly fee, while canadians and australians were offered a slightly cheaper rate of 6.99 canadian dollars (\u00a33.70) and 7.49 australian dollars (\u00a33.80). The content provided was distinct from that offered via the uk version, including older shows from the corporation's library in addition to recently broadcast programmes. In total, more than 2,000 hours of shows were on offer on the global edition of iplayer, including gavin and stacey, fawlty towers, planet earth and \"classic\" episodes of doctor who. Users have been notified of the switch-off, and auto-renewing subscriptions are being cancelled. \"we would like to thank all of our subscribers for using the service.

The transport workers' union's national secretary tony sheldon condemned the requested change to the fair work act and accused aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. ` major retailers like aldi are trying to turn the clocks back on our modern society to reintroduce serfdom,' mr sheldon in a statement. Aldi has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to workplace relations productivity commission. ` their model is to keep workers employed on vulnerable part - time and casual basis, increasing and reducing their hours when they see fit.' National secretary of the transport workers' union, tony sheldon, accused aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the workplace relations productivity commission, in which it recommended that the national employment standards be amended to `enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees `overwhelmingly supported' and `preferred' the proposals. ` aldi's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' david zalunardo, aldi's managing director, wrote. However mr sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to `strip workers of their rights'. ` the transport workers' union and its members acted against this billion - dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said.

La gommeuse achieved the top price of $67.5m (\u00a345m) at sotheby's, as part of their impressionist & modern art sale on thursday. And van gogh's atmospheric landscape, paysage sous un ciel mouvemente, sold for $54m (\u00a336m), helping to take the evening's total to $306.7m (\u00a3203m). Simon shaw, co-head of impressionist and modern art worldwide, called it \"a small sale that packed a real punch\". He added: \"each season picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise, and tonight was no exception, with the unusual appearance of two blue period works, which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper.\" La gommeuse, described as most the important blue period picasso to come to the market in a generation, was painted in 1901. The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman. Gommeuse, which translates into english as'gummy' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs. It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas, which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work. The caricature of picasso's friend pere manach was apparently intended as a gift for the catalan anarchist who shared the artist's studio flat in the boulevard de clichy in paris. The painting was one of 47 works on offer, with just over three-quarters finding buyers. At least two of the top 10 lots were bought by asian private collectors, continuing a trend of recent seasons. The $306.7m (\u00a3202m) total comfortably beat the $275m (\u00a3182m) low pre-sale estimate. Sotheby's had tagged the high estimate at about $370m (\u00a3244.5m). This total brings sotheby's sales of impressionist & modern art in just the past 24 hours to $575.8m (\u00a3381m),. Earlier this year, picasso's women of algiers became the most expensive painting to sell at auction, going for $160m (\u00a3102.6m) at christie's in new york."

It's yet to be confirmed if the song will appear on an album by any of the artists. Though producer ty dolla $ign did tell billboard earlier this month that the song is likely be part of west's upcoming release.

      "Article": "Indian restaurants are closing in scotland because strict immigration curbs mean it is difficult to recruit top chefs from the indian sub-continent, it has been claimed. The warning comes as the scottish curry industry will celebrate its annual awards ceremony in glasgow on monday. The rules prevent non-eu chefs being employed if a restaurant offers a take-away service. The uk government said this was designed to drive innovative cuisine. But industry sources say it has led to restaurants closing because they cannot recruit skilled chefs. The rules, laid down by the migration advisory committee (mac) and the home office, are part of the tier 2 visa scheme, which allows workers of sufficient skill levels to be employed on the shortage occupation list. They must be paid at least \u00e2\u00a329,570 a year, and to meet the criteria the job must also not be in a fast food or \"standard fare\" outlet, or an establishment which provides a take-away service. But ajmal mushtaq, who runs a restaurant in hamilton providing up to 3,000 meals a week, said that was \"total insanity\". Holding two portions of a curry - one on a plate, the other in a take-away carton - he said: \"here is a chicken tikka chasni, one of our top selling dishes. \"what the government are saying is: if i put that same dish into a container, i'm not allowed to bring expert chefs over from india. \"the quality is the exact same.\" Mr mushtaq said the restriction meant that plans to expand his restaurant have been put on hold. He currently employs three indian-born chefs who have been in scotland long enough to qualify for permanent resident status, but wants to increase his staffing. \"as a result of bringing over three chefs a few years ago, i have been able to create 52 jobs in this business,\" he said. \"we are at the point of expanding our business. If i were to bring over another two chefs, i would be able to increase the number of employees up to 95 in this one establishment alone.\" The industry has been putting pressure on the government to review its rules, particularly in the wake of the brexit vote, which it sees as offering an opportunity to workers outwith the eu. International development secretary priti patel, who campaigned for a leave vote said during the campaign, said it was a \"travesty\" that curry houses were subjected to a \"second class uk immigration system\" in comparison to eu chefs. With a growth in online apps such as hungry house and just eat promoting home delivery of food, hans ram, chief executive of the catering recruitment agency goldstar chefs, said the government approach to the indian restaurant sector was wrong. \"they have totally misunderstood and misconceived the industry as being a low-paid, low-skilled jobs base. Which it is not,\" he said. \"the biggest consequence to this is actually the skills erosion - erosion of authenticity. \"it is affecting the product that the public are being served.\" He also pointed out that the indian restaurant sector in the uk is worth an estimated \u00e2\u00a34bn a year."

But now the age of political correctness appears to have caught up with the queen's norfolk estate. For every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display and replaced with what one visitor called `trinkets and bric - a - brac'. Throwback : how the trophy room at sandringham used to look, complete with stuffed rhino heads. Bric - a - brac : sandringham's updated display - and even the blood - red walls have been repainted white. All 62 items - - including an indian tiger, a leopard, skins and tusks - - have been placed in storage. Even the blood - red walls have been painted white, as if to make clear the break with the past. The drastic change was apparent when the estate reopened its doors to the public on saturday. Following the winter closure, a new sign outside the sandringham museum makes pointed reference to how changing times have spelled the end for some exhibits. After explaining that the museum opened in 1928 to house george v's collection of `big game trophies', the message says : `thankfully, due to the work of organisations like the world wide fund for nature, whose president was hrh prince philip until 1996, this destructive era is drawing to a close - - the camera having replaced the gun in recording the sightings of these magnificent animals.' Questions were raised in december about the legality of `unworked items' - - those not fundamentally changed from their natural state - - dating from prior to 1947. Under a european council regulation, the uncarved ivory, stuffed lions and white rhinos all potentially broke the law as they were not on show with an official certificate.

Syd's garden will be \"laced with little clues\" about the singer, according to stephen pyle. Designed as a restful area for patients and staff, it will open in the grounds of addenbrooke's hospital in cambridge in 2018. Barrett, a founder member of pink floyd, died in 2006 after living locally as a semi-recluse. Read more cambridgeshire stories here. The garden has been designed by sculptor mr pyle and paul herrington, a garden designer. Their charity, art garden health, creates and maintains green spaces for nhs hospitals at no public cost. Addenbrooke's offered them a plot a year ago - and fundraising got under way. Mr pyle knew barrett as a young man when the two began saturday art classes at cambridge's homerton college. They were also members of band those without, which toured cambridge youth clubs and pubs between 1963 and 1965. They studied together at the cambridge school of art before barrett left for london - and mr pyle began a career in theatre set design. \"syd's sister said he liked roses,\" said mr pyle. \"and there'll be a striped colour theme, which fans will recognise. \"the artwork on his first solo album is turquoise and orange, and paul worked with those colours. \"there's also a nod to abbey road's crossing.\" The centrepiece will be a circular sculpture, depicting a teenage barrett on a bicycle, armed with a guitar and a paint palette. \"this was the syd i knew at art school,\" said mr pyle. \"the 18-year-old, the free wheeler. \"he wasn't ambitious for glory, just very creative and anarchic. He was very charismatic - and very, very talented.\" He described barrett as a \"celebrated son of cambridge\", who returned to the city and lived as a recluse until his death in 2006. In october 2016 a specially-designed artwork unveiled in the foyer of the cambridge corn exchange in october 2016, where he played his last live gig.

Reports suggest chinese buyers are acquiring the clothing retailer, which started in london in the 1850s. Its illustrious fans have included the queen mother, margaret thatcher and actors such as cary grant. But after the british firm was saved from administration in 2012, it has mainly focused on china and last year saw its uk sales fall 16%. Hong kong-based ygm trading, which bought it for \u00a315m four years ago, said aquascutum is due to be sold in march 2017 to two buyers. The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, ygm said in its annual report this week. Chinese textile firm shandong ruyi group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to bloomberg. Aquascutum started as a mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, john emary, patented the first waterproof textile. Its trench coats were worn by british soldiers during the first world war, while in 1953 its wyncol fabric - designed to withstand 100 mph winds - was used by explorer edmund hillary in the first confirmed ascent of mount everest. The coats were also a regular feature on the silver screen, with sean connery wearing one in another time, another place in 1958 and sophia loren in the key. However, the retailer has struggled in recent years, closing its nottinghamshire factory in 2012 and then falling into administration. Under ygm's ownership, the company's primary focus has been china, with 135 of its 146 outlets located in mainland china, hong kong, macau and taiwan. Last year it closed 14 stores in china amid declining sales, but opened one in europe.

Previously, trainee doctors had to wait up to four years to experience the consultation room. Gp live was developed by aberdeen university and uses streaming software to enter the consultation room. Researchers hope it will encourage more students to join general practice and help ease a recruitment crisis. The software will stream consultations just moments after they happen in an effort to give students a flavour of life as a gp. The system utilises one of the university's digitally enhanced learning spaces (dels), where students can engage in interactive learning with the aid of 55-inch display screens and state-of-the-art web conference tools. It was developed by dr john mckeown, a senior clinical lecturer and gp at cults medical group in aberdeen. He said: \"the biggest appeal for students is that they are seeing consultations that are almost live, and this adds a sense of immediacy that appeals to students who have grown up in an era where digitisation has made learning far more interactive. \"we aim to make the sessions as engaging as possible by discussing the gp's approach while the consultation takes place - for example how they communicate, the direction that they take the consultation, and of course their recommended course of action.\" Dr mckeown said that one of the main benefits of the system was that students and lecturers would be able to discuss consultations that have taken place at a variety of practices, where the issues could be very different. He added: \"this means that students get a real insight into the challenges facing gps who might operate in less affluent areas, or in remote rural locations. \"the system also allows us to work through a number of different consultations in succession, which very much mimics a typical morning for a gp. \"this allows us to see the range of skills - interpersonal, diagnostic and otherwise - that they bring to a normal working day.\" Dr mckeown said that by the time current first year students graduated there would be a pressing need for new gps in scotland."

The union eventually backed down after a backlash from students, one of whom described the exclusive policy as `patronising beyond belief'. The event, held on wednesday, was organised by welfare and diversity officer bahar mustafa, who said she hoped to persuade academics to broaden courses to include more material relating to minority groups.

Speaking after briefing the security council on the peace process, staffan de mistura said a partial truce agreed in february was \"barely alive\". Violence in syria has intensified in recent days, despite the ceasefire. At least 20 civilians were reportedly killed on wednesday in government strikes on a hospital and nearby residential building in eastern aleppo. The dead included children, a dentist and the only paediatrician left in rebel-held areas of the city, civil defence volunteers told afp news agency. The upsurge in fighting in syria's largest city comes amid reports that government forces, backed by russian air power, are gearing up for a major offensive there. Russia's continuing war. Has opportunity for peace been lost? What is left of syria? Assad's growing confidence. The escalation has threatened to derail the un-brokered peace talks, which resumed last month. The western-backed opposition delegation, the high negotiations committee (hnc), last week suspended its role to protest against alleged ceasefire violations by the government and a fall in humanitarian aid deliveries to besieged areas. Speaking on wednesday after a third round of talks in geneva, mr de mistura said the fragile \"cessation of hostilities\" \"could collapse any time\". He said that over the past 48 hours an average of one syrian had been killed every 25 minutes and one wounded every 13 minutes. For the peace talks to succeed, mr de mistura said, hostilities would need to be reduced to the levels seen immediately following the february agreement. Calling on the us and russia to co-operate, mr de mistura said that the legacies of both president barack obama and president vladimir putin were linked to the success of the peace process in syria. There will be one or two more rounds of talks before july, mr de mistura said. He added: \"there are still major differences on the major issues, but there is movement on certain areas where there was not before.\" Mr de mistura also said that equal rights and equal representation in major institutions for women was essential to the transition to a new syria. The peace talks do not involve the al-qaeda-linked al-nusra front and the so-called islamic state, which have been fighting government forces and other rebels across syria. The uk-based syrian observatory for human rights monitoring group confirmed on wednesday that the air strikes on a hospital and nearby buildings in aleppo were carried out by \"regime airplanes\". Separately, 11 people were killed in western aleppo earlier on wednesday, the syrian observatory said.

Mccoy has two rides at sandown on saturday before he retires from professional racing for good. ` it is a bit like watching lionel messi on a horse,' said thornton. ` he had so much time but he has a technique you wouldn't teach to anybody. ` it might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20 - time champion but it is unique. He keeps the bit high up in the horse's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount's neck. But ap loves to be in 100 per cent control. Whatever his mount does, it is his decision. ` he judges pace so well. He leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for jonjo o' neill. ` when he was with martin pipe, it was often a case of make sure you put everyone to the sword a mile from home. He would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around cheltenham in the early days that would not get beaten now. ` he is very aware of what is going on around him. If you look at this year's grand national, and when he won it in 2010 on don't push it, he had so much room. He finds room in a race and uses it. ` you also never know how much he has left in the tank. You very rarely see him sitting still. It is a bit like a coiled spring.' Mccoy ( left -"

      "Article": "The female governor at a private muslim school in birmingham - at the centre of criticism from ofsted - chose to sit separately from men, says the school. Inspectors criticised darul uloom school when they saw a \"female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room\". But a statement from the school says the school did not segregate, but was respecting the governor's choice. A wave of ofsted inspections found nine private faith schools \"inadequate\". Ofsted chief sir michael wilshaw had written on tuesday to education secretary nicky morgan with the findings of inspections of 22 private faith schools, in cities including manchester, coventry, birmingham and leicester. These had formerly been inspected by an independent group - the bridge schools inspectorate - but from this autumn ofsted has taken over responsibility for carrying out checks. Religious studies gcse'error of law' inspectors raised concerns including that some of these private faith schools were not \"promoting fundamental british values\" and were not encouraging \"mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs\". They highlighted particular concern about darul uloom islamic high school in birmingham, where inspectors observed that \"the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting. \"as a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement. \"a senior hmi has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women.\" In response, a statement from the school says that visitors, parents and governors can \"sit where and how they wish as they feel comfortable, and we never assert any restrictions on this\". The private boys' schools says it has an \"open door policy\" and has hosted meetings including for a local faith forum and for the west midlands police. The school issued a statement from the unnamed governor saying that \"my request to sit as i please\" was a way of \"demonstrating the school's strong promotion of both islamic and british values\". \"the right for a person to choose is a universal value,\" she said. But she claimed that the \"british values\" requirement was opposed to this. Darul uloom, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by ofsted inspectors since 2011. In october 2013, ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as \"forward thinking\". Ofsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the bsi inspection system. Among the 22 schools inspected 15 were muslim and seven christian. They had been part of a group of about 50 private schools which had been assessed by the bridge schools inspectorate, which now is no longer approved to inspect schools. Among the 22 schools inspected by ofsted, one was \"outstanding\", four were rated \"good\", eight were rated as \"requires improvement\" and nine were \"inadequate\". Sir michael's letter to the education secretary says it should be a priority to inspect other former bridge schools inspectorate schools."

Smith declines his choice to review the decision with hotspot not available in this test series. With hotspot technology not available in this test as part of the decision review system, smith declined to try his luck upstairs and walked off.

The figures also revealed that more than 560,000 people missed at least one nhs outpatient appointment in 2014/15. Each missed appointment is thought to cost the nhs \u00e2\u00a3120, putting the total cost to the health service at \u00e2\u00a3100m. The figures were obtained by the scottish conservatives through a freedom of information request. The statistics revealed:. The scottish tories have previously suggested those who fail to show for appointments on a certain number of occasions could face some sanction from the health board. The party has also urged the scottish government look at more innovative ways of reminding patients to turn up at appointments. Scottish conservative leader ruth davidson said: \"missing a hospital appointment can happen to anyone, and for a range of reasons. \"but when you're getting to the point where you are missing five or more in the space of just a year, something really has to be done. \"that is costing the nhs thousands of pounds, wreaking havoc with hospital planning, and of course potentially harming the health of the patient involved. \"we've been critical of the nhs in the past for cancelling appointments and procedures, so it's only fair we do everything we can to make sure patient no-shows are limited too. \"we need to find ways to ensure people turn up at the appointments that are made and stop showing contempt for our nhs, doctors and nursing staff.\" Health secretary shona robison said the percentage of patients missing appointments has decreased slightly over the last five years. She added: \"however, it is important that all health boards understand why patients are not attending appointments and look at ways to reduce this. \"the scottish government is committed to supporting health boards to deliver secure messaging services, including reminders. \"health scotland also recently published a report looking at those who did not attend appointments over a 10 year period from 2002/03 to 2011/12. \"we welcome this report which will provide boards with further learning on the issue of non-attendance.\""

They say the arrests happened when protesters refused to leave land owned by the pipeline company. A spokesman said the latest arrests brought the number detained since august to almost 700. They came after the us army was ordered to allow the construction of the final section of the dakota access pipeline. Native americans and their supporters have protested against the project for months, and have vowed to fight on. The standing rock sioux tribe say the final section - under lake oahe, a reservoir on the missouri river - would contaminate drinking water on their land and damage sacred burial sites. Morton county sheriff's office spokesman rob keller said the latest arrests were made after demonstrators moved from their existing camp on flood-prone ground to land owned by the pipeline company, energy transfer partners. He said no injuries had been reported during the operation. Protest leaders could not be reached for comment.

At least two missiles were fired at a house in north waziristan tribal region early on wednesday, the deadliest drone attack in pakistan this year. It is the third such attack since new pm nawaz sharif won elections in may. He has demanded an end to such attacks. A government statement said the strike violated pakistan's sovereignty. \"pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the importance of bringing an immediate end to drone strikes,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said. \"they are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications.\" In a separate development, at least six security personnel are reported to have been killed and at least six more injured in an early morning attack by militants at a checkpoint near peshawar. At least two more are reported to be missing, possibly kidnapped by the attackers. Reports citing local officials said most of those killed in the drone strike were thought to be from the militant haqqani group. Officials say four missiles were fired by a us drone, targeting two houses and two vehicles, near miranshah, the main town in north waziristan. A number of other people were also injured. The haqqani network has been described by us military commanders as one of the most resilient militant groups operating in afghanistan. The troubled border region is a known stronghold for al-qaeda and taliban militants. Seven people were killed in a similar strike on 8 june, also in north waziristan, just three days after the new prime minister was sworn in. After that incident the pakistani government summoned a senior us diplomat in protest, condemning what it called a \"violation of pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity\". At least two key leaders of the pakistani taliban have been killed in earlier us drone strikes this year. Mullah nazir was killed in january and waliur rehman was killed in may, shortly after mr sharif swept to election victory. The bbc's richard galpin in islamabad says that the latest air strike by us forces will further heighten tensions between washington and the new pakistani government. Mr sharif has called for a joint strategy to stop us drone strikes. The issue is hugely controversial in pakistan, where parts of the government and military have often been accused of criticising the use of drones in public, but co-operating in private. Drone strikes are a source of severe tension between the us and pakistan. It is estimated that between 2004 and 2013, cia drone attacks in pakistan killed up to 3,460 people. About 890 of them were civilians and the vast majority of strikes were carried out by the obama administration, research by the bureau of investigative journalism said. Earlier this year, mr obama called the strikes part of a legitimate campaign against terrorism, but he also pledged more programme transparency and stricter targeting rules."

      "Article": "Legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in scotland has been backed by the holyrood committee looking into the proposals. Most msps on the equal opportunities committee endorsed the marriage and civil partnership bill. But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections. The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law. Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings. Same-sex couples in scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. Both the church of scotland and roman catholic church are opposed to the proposals. The convener of the equal opportunities committee, labour msp margaret mcculloch, said: \"all of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue. \"while the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the scottish parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience.\" The bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration. Tom french, of the equality network charity, said backing the bill would help remove discrimination from law. \"with just days to go before the crucial stage-one vote on the equal marriage bill, we urge msps to stand up for a fairer and more equal scotland by giving this milestone legislation their full support,\" he said. \"the large majority of people in scotland believe it's time lgbt people had full equality, including the right to marry the person they love. This bill will remove discrimination from the law and send out an important message about the kind of country we are.\" But campaign group scotland for marriage renewed its call for safeguards in the legislation to protect those opposed to it. A spokesman said: \"the scottish government's promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow. \"real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of scots who don't support this law. \"no one who supports the law as it stands should be discriminated against. At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected.\" In england and wales, the marriage (same sex couples) act was passed into law in july. It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year when the relevant statutory orders have been put in place. The act will allow religious organisations to \"opt in\" to offering weddings, with the church of england and church in wales being banned in law from doing so."

A tractor laden with explosives was driven at a military police station, a statement said. The attack happened early on sunday near the town of dogubayezit in agri province, near the border with iran. Since 24 july, turkey has carried out hundreds of air raids on pkk bases on both sides of the iraq-turkey border. A turkish state news agency, anadolu, said the tractor was carrying two tons of explosives that were detonated by a suicide bomber. Turkey's army said in a statement that \"long-range guns\" were also found. Four of the injured were in a serious condition. The statement said the karabulak gendarmerie station was hit at around 03:00 local time on sunday (midnight gmt). Images in the turkish press showed a badly-damaged building with the roof destroyed. One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured. The dogan news agency added that militants also set up ambushes on roads to prevent medical teams getting to the scene. There has been no comment from the pkk so far. Afp news agency said it would be the first time the group was accused of deploying a suicide bomber during recent clashes. Turkey says the group was behind a number of attacks in the last two weeks:. Turkey's official news agency says about 260 kurdish fighters have been killed in strikes in northern iraq and turkey since 24 july. It has also targeted positions held by the islamic state group. At least six people were killed and several wounded in further turkish air strikes on saturday east of erbil, said local officials. The pro-pkk firat news agency described an attack on the village of zerkel as a \"massacre\". Iraqi kurdish president massoud barzani said: \"we condemn the bombing, which led to the martyrdom of the citizens of the kurdish region, and we call on turkey to not repeat the bombing of civilians.\" The turkish military on sunday said it had investigated the incident and dismissed claims that there could have been civilian casualties in zerkel, reuters reported. Turkey considers both the pkk and is terrorist organisations. The pkk has been fighting turkey for an autonomous homeland for the kurds. More than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the pkk began an armed uprising in 1984. In 2012, the government and pkk began peace talks and the following year a ceasefire was agreed. However, the ceasefire ended in effect when turkey launched raids against kurdish separatist camps in northern iraq last month. The raids came after the pkk reportedly killed two turkish police officers in retaliation for an attack claimed by islamic state and what the pkk sees as turkey's collaboration with is."

The caller even pretended he knew of a list of previous transactions the elderly couple had made, initially rattling off eight incorrect withdrawals before correctly guessing a $ 50 shopping bill at asda. Consequently the couple were persuaded to go to their local leeds building society and make transfers from their account and makes others from their hsbc savings totalling $ 36, 140 to other accounts. The cash was immediately withdrawn after the transfers and were used pay for travellers cheques and euros at travel agents.

It began in november but 20 cases have been notified in the last week and the total is more than for the whole of wales in the last three years. So far, 32 secondary schools, primary schools and nurseries are affected. Parents are being urged to make sure their children receive the measles, mumps and rubella (mmr) vaccination. The outbreak only affects the abertawe bro morgannwg university health board area and eclipses the number of cases across the whole of wales since 2010. Last year's figure of confirmed cases for wales stood at 116, while there were just 19 in 2011 and eight the year before, according to public health wales. There were 159 cases in 2009, still lower than the current outbreak in south west wales. Dr marion lyons, director of health protection for public health wales (phw), said: \"we continue to be concerned at the number of cases of measles we are seeing in the swansea and neath port talbot areas. \"we cannot emphasise enough that measles is an illness that can kill, or leave patients with permanent complications including severe brain damage, and the only protection is two doses of the mmr vaccination.\" She added that people most at risk of catching measles are children of school age who have not had two doses of mmr. Children should receive the first dose of the vaccine at 12 to 13 months of age and the second at three years and four months of age. Phw estimates there are more than 8,500 school children at risk of measles in the abertawe bro morgannwg area. Many people who catch measles will have a fever, cough, red eyes, and blocked nose and feel generally unwell. The blotchy rash appears a few days later beginning on the face and spreading downwards to the rest of the body over several days."

Herbert kilpin left nottingham to work in italy in the 1890s and later set up the club, becoming the team's first superstar in the process. Robert nieri has been fundraising for a plaque to go outside his birthplace to mark 100 years since his death. He said kilpin was the \"father of italian football\" and deserved more recognition in nottingham. You can read more stories about people who have helped shape sport on our pinterest board. The footballer, who was born at the back of a butcher's shop in mansfield road, started milan football and cricket club in 1899. Kilpin led the club to its first three championships and even designed its legendary red and black striped shirt. He died in 1916, aged 46, and his grave was believed lost until a historian tracked it down. In 1999, ac milan paid for a new tombstone and he was reburied in the monumental cemetery in milan. Kilpin's name adorns shirts in milan and his image can be seen on giant banners on match days. However, in nottingham, there has been little recognition of his achievements and writer mr nieri set out to change that. \"we need to bring kilpin to the fore,\" he said. \"he is the founder of one of the most successful clubs in the world and the father of italian football. \"he taught the italians to play. He's massive [in milan].\" On 22 october, the 100th anniversary of kilpin's death, a ceremony will take place outside his birthplace, and the sheriff of nottingham will name a bus after him. Mr nieri, whose book the lord of milan is set to be released, is also due to fly to italy to start filming a documentary about the star. The humble man who made milan. Details about herbert kilpin's remarkable life only started to emerge over the past few decades. How did a whisky-guzzling, chain-smoking son of a butcher from nottingham come to set up one of the world's biggest and most successful clubs? Other english ex-pats helped him, of course, but it is kilpin who has remained in the imagination here and in italy. While his friends became part of the fledgling italian football association, kilpin just wanted to play football. And that is why, according to some, he is a \"grassroots football icon\" - concerned only by what happened on the pitch. It is hoped more recognition of his story will inspire a generation of young footballers. Source: the lord of milan."

The cumbernauld-based firm, which also makes rubicon and tizer, said it would cut irn bru's sugar content from about 10g per 100ml to just below 5g. It will reduce the calorie count per can from just under 140 to about 66. Ag barr said the move was part of a \"long-standing sugar reduction programme\". It confirmed in a stock market announcement on wednesday that more than 90% of its portfolio would contain less than 5g of total sugar per 100ml by this autumn. Tizer is already below that threshold, while the rubicon carbonates range will all have less than 5g of sugar per 100ml by the middle of this year, the company said. The uk government plans to introduce a levy on sugary drinks in april 2018. The soft drinks industry levy (sdil) will have two bands in the uk - one for soft drinks with more than 5g of sugar per 100ml and a higher one for drinks with more than 8g per 100ml. Ministers hope the move will help tackle the nation's obesity problem. A spokesman for the company said: \"irn bru will still be made with sugar. We are not removing all the sugar, but we are reducing the amount. \"having worked on this for some time, we are carefully blending and balancing a mix of sugar, sweeteners and our original and best flavour essence to deliver the great taste of irn bru but with less sugar. \"we're doing this because evidence shows that most consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks. \"86% of consumers are concerned about the amount of sugar in food and drink that they consume. \"that said, we have taken the soft drinks sugar tax thresholds into account when determining the levels of sugar reduction, but never compromising on taste.\" In the past year, the company has introduced two new drinks - irn bru xtra and rubicon spring - both of which contain no added sugar. Chief executive roger white said: \"evidence shows that consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks. \"we've responded by significantly reducing sugar across our portfolio in recent years, through reformulation and innovation. \"today's announcement builds on this progress and we are now expanding our successful sugar reduction plans to include our iconic irn bru brand.\" He added: \"we will continue to respond to our consumers and adapt to their changing preferences, offering great tasting products that are right for this generation of consumers and the next.\""
